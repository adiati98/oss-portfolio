      <td>- [X ] 👍 My pull request has a descriptive title (such as `Added Matilda` or `Added all of Jane Austen's books`)
- [X ] 🕵🏽‍♀️ I have searched the `data.js` file and confirmed I am not adding a duplicate entry.
- [X ] 💜 I have checked Issues and Pull Requests to confirm I am not adding a duplicate entry that is pending approval.
- [ X] 🖍️ I have placed the new books(s) or play(s) in alphabetical order based on `title` inside of the `data.js` file. 
- [X ] 4️⃣ I have at least four emojis listed under `emojiImgs`
- [X ] 6️⃣ I have a maximum of six emojis listed under `emojiImgs`.
- [ X] ⭐ My genres are all inside of square brackets `[ ]` and each are individually wrapped in quotation marks and have a comma between each one. (such as submitting this `&quot;genres&quot;: [&quot;fantasy&quot;, &quot;children&quot;, &quot;adventure&quot;]` and not this `&quot;genres&quot;:[&quot;fantasy, children, adventure&quot;]`). 
- [ X] 💜 I have used genres from this [genre.md](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojipages/blob/master/genres.md) file or if I want to use genres not in this file already, I have added them to this file in alphabetical order.
- [X ] 📅 I have added a single year under `year`. 

Closes #65
