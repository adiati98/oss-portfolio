      <td>- [X ] 👍 My pull request has a descriptive title (such as `Added Matilda` or `Added all of Jane Austen's books`)
- [X ] 🕵🏽‍♀️ I have searched the `data.js` file and confirmed I am not adding a duplicate entry.
- [X ] 💜 I have checked Issues and Pull Requests to confirm I am not adding a duplicate entry that is pending approval.
