This would be a great place to add two things: a developer Resources page that links to a section on how to ask for help with your code. <br><br>### Proposed solution<br>- [ ] Add a new folder in resources called `dev`<br>- [ ] In that folder add an index.md file for `Developer Resources`. (You can check the [virtual-coffee index](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/resources/virtual-coffee/index.md) for an idea of how to do it with updated content for this section.<br>- [ ] Add a `Guide to Asking Questions about Your Code` page called `coding-questions-guide.md`. You can look at [the guide to VC](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/resources/virtual-coffee/guide-to-vc.md) as an example.<br>     - Use the replies to [discussion 409](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/discussions/409), to create the guide.<br>     - Sections should include `Before asking for help`, `When asking for help`, `Specific to Virtual Coffee`. (Feel free to retitle those, but the content should reflect that, unless you have suggestions for a different organization.<br></td>
