If you have a pull request related to a current issue please link to that issue number.

That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword "Closes" followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

## Description

- Add a note to view a page on localhost when encountering `TimeoutError - Task timed out after 10.00 seconds`.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

-->

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

Every time I run `yarn dev`, I get a `TimeoutError - Task timed out after 10.00 seconds` message.
Depending on the computer's speed, I believe some of us encounter the same error.
However, we can get around it by adding the path to the targeted page to the localhost after the server runs.

### Proposed solution

Add a note about adding the path to the `yarn dev` section at `README.md`.

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over "by hand."

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `src > newsletter > issues` and create a new file `2022-06.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `src > newsletter > issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in [Newsletters section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

We get recurring questions that have been answered. And we also received valuable resources from our members in our Slack channels.

### Proposed solution

Create a page—like "Developer Resources"—to compile the resources that both members and non-members can consume.
We can include this page in the Member Resources.

### Context for content change

As we are pausing our membership for Virtual Coffee, we need to update the page.

### Proposed solution

There are a couple of ways that I can propose:
- Change the content of the [How can I join Virtual Coffee?](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee/join-virtual-coffee#how-can-i-join-virtual-coffee) section into some sort of announcement like "We are currently pausing our membership ..." and leave the rest of the sections as it is.
- Create a new file with an announcement of pausing the membership and provide links to our Guide To Virtual Coffee for members as a sneak peek for non-members, along with our newsletter, Twitter, and email for the public to keep in touch with us.

@danieltott & @BekahHW, any thoughts?

I will take this issue after confirmation and get assigned to me.
Thank you 😊
