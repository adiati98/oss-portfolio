      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

Every time I run `yarn dev`, I get a `TimeoutError - Task timed out after 10.00 seconds` message.
Depending on the computer's speed, I believe some of us encounter the same error.
However, we can get around it by adding the path to the targeted page to the localhost after the server runs.

### Proposed solution

Add a note about adding the path to the `yarn dev` section at `README.md`.

      <td>## Issue Context

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over "by hand."

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `src > newsletter > issues` and create a new file `2022-06.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `src > newsletter > issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in [Newsletters section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

If you have questions, please let us know. We're up for pairing if anyone wants to walk through this!</td>

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

We get recurring questions that have been answered. And we also received valuable resources from our members in our Slack channels.

### Proposed solution

Create a pageâ€”like "Developer Resources"â€”to compile the resources that both members and non-members can consume.
We can include this page in the Member Resources.

Edit/Clarification on existing content

### URL of existing page

https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee/join-virtual-coffee

### Context for content change

As we are pausing our membership for Virtual Coffee, we need to update the page.

### Proposed solution

There are a couple of ways that I can propose:
- Change the content of the [How can I join Virtual Coffee?](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee/join-virtual-coffee#how-can-i-join-virtual-coffee) section into some sort of announcement like "We are currently pausing our membership ..." and leave the rest of the sections as it is.
- Create a new file with an announcement of pausing the membership and provide links to our Guide To Virtual Coffee for members as a sneak peek for non-members, along with our newsletter, Twitter, and email for the public to keep in touch with us.
