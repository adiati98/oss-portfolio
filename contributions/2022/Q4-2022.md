I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to embed videos but certainly grabbing some data in the loader and displaying them here could be cool. This would take some more design thought obviously, and it might not even work visually, so if someone took this part on, you&#39;d have to be ok with possibly trashing the work at the end if that&#39;s what happens.~<br><br>~This would need to be a server-side thing (done in the loader), not a client-side thing.
