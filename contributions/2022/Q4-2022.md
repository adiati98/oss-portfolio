      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?<br><br>- [X] I have searched the existing issues<br><br>### Issue Context<br><br>There&#39;s not a ton of visibility to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@VirtualCoffeeIO) on the site - I think a good spot for this would be the top of the [events page](https://virtualcoffee.io/events).<br><br><br><br>### Proposed solution<br><br>The simplest solution would be an additional paragraph in the intro section saying something like &quot;many of our events are recorded, you can find them here&quot;. Or maybe a little bit more calling out some of our playlists/series...<br><br>Bonus points:<br><br>~Not sure if this is a good idea or not, but we could pull in the latest x videos and display bigger thumbnails links to them? I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to embed videos but certainly grabbing some data in the loader and displaying them here could be cool. This would take some more design thought obviously, and it might not even work visually, so if someone took this part on, you&#39;d have to be ok with possibly trashing the work at the end if that&#39;s what happens.~<br><br>~This would need to be a server-side thing (done in the loader), not a client-side thing. IE I won&#39;t want to be loading any client-side js from youtube.~<br><br>Edit: Doing this later<br><br>### Alternatives Considered<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Additional Resources<br><br>- [YouTube Data API Node.js Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/nodejs)<br>- [remix loaders](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#loader)<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [X] I&#39;ve read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community</td>

      <td>Please help improve the transcript for this episode.<br><br>- You can either listen to the episode and improve the transcript based on what you hear.<br>- Another option is to read through the transcript and improve it purely based on the issues you detect when reading it.<br>- You do not have to improve the complete transcript. You can also only work on half of it.<br>- Every little help to make the podcast more accessible is awesome.<br>- If you need help, please feel free to reach out to me<br><br>BTW, the transcript has an intentional ~80-chars max line wrap (i.e., a new line starts after max 80 chars). Please keep it in that format. Thank you.</td>
