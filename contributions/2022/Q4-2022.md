A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Issue Context

Our podcast's transcriptions are automatically generated, so there would be typos or missing words. 

We want to improve every episode's transcription so they can be accessible to everyone. Currently, we are doing this manually.

## Steps To Update

- Open the file of the podcast's episode. 
  e.g.: `1_0.srt` means season 1 episode 0
-  Listen to the podcast's episode and improve the transcript based on your hearing.
-  [Fix the format](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/podcast-transcripts#fixing-formatting-issues) by running `yarn check-srt`.
- After running `yarn check-srt`, fix timestamps suggestions format manually, if any.

## Accessibility Resources

- [Transcribing Audio to Text - W3C WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcribing/)

### Context for documentation change

Noticed some contributors made changes directly on `main` branch. We want to make sure that we provide information that all contributors should create a new branch to work on changes to avoid pushing changes directly to `main` branch and keep it clean.

### Proposed solution

- Add information and how to create new branch in the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- We can use the [Local Development](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development) section to add this information.
- Maybe change the title as well to &quot;Working On Issues&quot; or &quot;Local Environment Preparation&quot; or &quot;Setting Up Local Environment&quot;.
- Link the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to all VC repos.

**Additional and need some thoughts**:
- Link the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to [Working on the site](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#working-on-the-site) section in the `README.md`.
  It would be something like:
    ```markdown
      ## Working on the site
      - This site is built using Remix.
      - Please refer to our CONTRIBUTING guidelines to make contributions.
     ```

@danieltott we have a section of [Working With Issues](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-with-issues).
Would the new title of &quot;Working On Issues&quot; be confusing?
I'm thinking of &quot;Local Environment Preparation&quot; or &quot;Setting Up Local Environment&quot;. Any thoughts?

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

There's not a ton of visibility to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@VirtualCoffeeIO) on the site - I think a good spot for this would be the top of the [events page](https://virtualcoffee.io/events).



### Proposed solution

The simplest solution would be an additional paragraph in the intro section saying something like &quot;many of our events are recorded, you can find them here&quot;. Or maybe a little bit more calling out some of our playlists/series...

Bonus points:

~Not sure if this is a good idea or not, but we could pull in the latest x videos and display bigger thumbnails links to them? I don't think I'd want to embed videos but certainly grabbing some data in the loader and displaying them here could be cool. This would take some more design thought obviously, and it might not even work visually, so if someone took this part on, you'd have to be ok with possibly trashing the work at the end if that's what happens.~

~This would need to be a server-side thing (done in the loader), not a client-side thing. IE I won't want to be loading any client-side js from youtube.~

Edit: Doing this later

### Issue Context

To make it easier to find, let's add a link to [our Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct) in the footer of the site.

### Proposed solution

In [app/components/layouts/Root.jsx](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/app/components/layouts/Root.jsx), add a link to `/code-of-conduct` right after the &quot;Contact Us&quot; link.

- Another option is to read through the transcript and improve it purely based on the issues you detect when reading it.
- You do not have to improve the complete transcript. You can also only work on half of it.
- Every little help to make the podcast more accessible is awesome.
- If you need help, please feel free to reach out to me

BTW, the transcript has an intentional ~80-chars max line wrap (i.e., a new line starts after max 80 chars). Please keep it in that format. Thank you.</td>

      <td>---

### Note - only PRs from existing Virtual Coffee members participating in the Virtual Coffee Hacktoberfest Initiative will be accepted.

---

### First step - complete #13 if you haven't already!

If you haven't completed #13 already, it is perfectly fine to do that _and_ this in the same Pull Request.

### Steps:

- Find your member file (it will be `members/members/yourgithubuser.ts` where `yourgithubuser` is your user name on github.
- Near the end of the file, there is a `badges` array:
  ```js
  badges: [],
  ```
- Add `'Hacktoberfest2022'` to the array
- Save, commit, and file a Pull Request!
- Bonus: while you're in there, take a look at the `flare` section for a little bit of fun 😁

Our [original issue for adding your member profile](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/13) has a lot of details about previewing locally and interacting with GitHub - definitely check that out if you'd like to preview locally!

## Steps
_I need to add some thoughts on design, but for now, it needs to stay consistent with the colors and fonts we've been using._
- [ ] Create a file called MindfulnessScreen
- [ ] For this screen, let's start by hard-coding this mindfulness activity:
       - &quot;Let's be present at this moment through all of our senses: What do you hear? What do you see? What can you taste? 
       What can you smell? What can you feel?&quot;
- [ ] In the positivity toolbox, add this to the path for the mindfulness card.
