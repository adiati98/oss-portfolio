A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

If you have a pull request related to a current issue please link to that issue number.

That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword &quot;Closes&quot; followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

## Description

- Add &quot;Recorded Events&quot; section to the Events page.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Issue Context

Our podcast's transcriptions are automatically generated, so there would be typos or missing words. 

We want to improve every episode's transcription so they can be accessible to everyone. Currently, we are doing this manually.

## Steps To Update

- Open the file of the podcast's episode. 
  e.g.: `1_0.srt` means season 1 episode 0
-  Listen to the podcast's episode and improve the transcript based on your hearing.
-  [Fix the format](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/podcast-transcripts#fixing-formatting-issues) by running `yarn check-srt`.
- After running `yarn check-srt`, fix timestamps suggestions format manually, if any.

## Accessibility Resources

- [Transcribing Audio to Text - W3C WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcribing/)

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

Noticed some contributors made changes directly on `main` branch. We want to make sure that we provide information that all contributors should create a new branch to work on changes to avoid pushing changes directly to `main` branch and keep it clean.

### Proposed solution

- Add information and how to create new branch in the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- We can use the [Local Development](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development) section to add this information.
- Maybe change the title as well to &quot;Working On Issues&quot; or &quot;Local Environment Preparation&quot; or &quot;Setting Up Local Environment&quot;.
- Link the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to all VC repos.

**Additional and need some thoughts**:
- Link the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to [Working on the site](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#working-on-the-site) section in the `README.md`.
  It would be something like:
    ```markdown
      ## Working on the site
      - This site is built using Remix.
      - Please refer to our CONTRIBUTING guidelines to make contributions.
     ```

### Collaborators

@danieltott we have a section of [Working With Issues](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-with-issues).
Would the new title of &quot;Working On Issues&quot; be confusing?
I'm thinking of &quot;Local Environment Preparation&quot; or &quot;Setting Up Local Environment&quot;. Any thoughts?

Noticed some contributors made changes directly on `main` branch. We want to make sure that we provide information that all contributors should create a new branch to work on changes to avoid pushing changes directly to `main` branch and keep it clean.

### Proposed solution

- Add information and how to create new branch in the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- We can use the [Local Development](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development) section to add this information.
- Maybe change the title as well to &quot;Working On Issues&quot; or &quot;Local Environment Preparation&quot; or &quot;Setting Up Local Environment&quot;.
- Link the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to all VC repos.

**Additional and need some thoughts**:
- Link the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to [Working on the site](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#working-on-the-site) section in the `README.md`.

Our podcast's transcriptions are automatically generated, so there would be typos or missing words. 

We want to improve every episode's transcription so they can be accessible to everyone. Currently, we are doing this manually.

## Steps To Update

- Open the file of the podcast's episode. 
  e.g.: `1_0.srt` means season 1 episode 0
-  Listen to the podcast's episode and improve the transcript based on your hearing.
-  [Fix the format](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/podcast-transcripts#fixing-formatting-issues) by running `yarn check-srt`.
- After running `yarn check-srt`, fix timestamps suggestions format manually, if any.

Noticed some contributors made changes directly on `main` branch. We want to make sure that we provide information that all contributors should create a new branch to work on changes to avoid pushing changes directly to `main` branch and keep it clean.

### Proposed solution

- Add information and how to create new branch in the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- We can use the [Local Development](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development) section to add this information.
- Maybe change the title as well to &quot;Working On Issues&quot; or &quot;Local Environment Preparation&quot; or &quot;Setting Up Local Environment&quot;.
- Link the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to all VC repos.

**Additional and need some thoughts**:
- Link the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to [Working on the site](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#working-on-the-site) section in the `README.md`.
  It would be something like:
    ```markdown

@danieltott we have a section of [Working With Issues](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-with-issues).
Would the new title of &quot;Working On Issues&quot; be confusing?
