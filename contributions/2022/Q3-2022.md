      <td>## Issue Context

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over "by hand."

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `app > routes > newsletter > issues` and create a new file `2022-09.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `app > routes > newsletter > issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in [Newsletters section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

As we are improving the Git & GitHub 101 page (issue #628), we want as well edit "The Contributing Guide" in the [Documentation section](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/open-source/maintainer-guide#documentation) of the Maintainer Guide page.

I don't think we need the first point within The Contributing Guide as per attached pic.

### Proposed solution

Remove point one and move it to or tweak "The README" part in the [Documentation section](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/open-source/maintainer-guide#documentation).

### Context for documentation change

We need to update some of our existing member docs because of these conditions:
- We have some new channels on Slack.
- We now have Coffee Tables.
- We want to explain the bot announcements and how to join coffees and events. 

### Proposed solution

Update the `guide-to-vc` and `slack-channel-guide` to cover the conditions above.
