## Description

- Add March 2022 newsletter to the website.

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword &quot;Closes&quot; followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

I know Eddie from Twitter and have been following him since then 😊
Going further in my learning journey, I develop a huge interest in open source.

I did some open source contributions during Hacktoberfest, but I'm still afraid to contribute outside the event.
That's the reason why I want to join this community. To learn much more about open-source with the community and find more courage in contributing to more open source.</td>

I know Eddie from Twitter and have been following him since then 😊
Going further in my learning journey, I develop a huge interest in open source.

I did some open source contributions during Hacktoberfest, but I'm still afraid to contribute outside the event.
That's the reason why I want to join this community. To learn much more about open-source with the community and find more courage in contributing to more open source.</td>

### Additional Context

I know Eddie from Twitter and have been following him since then 😊
Going further in my learning journey, I develop a huge interest in open source.

I did some open source contributions during Hacktoberfest, but I'm still afraid to contribute outside the event.
That's the reason why I want to join this community. To learn much more about open-source with the community and find more courage in contributing to more open source.</td>

      <td>## Issue Context

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of sending it out. Currently, we're moving them over &quot;by hand.&quot;

You can look at the existing newsletters ( src &gt; newsletter &gt; issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs to be updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items.

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to src &gt; newsletter &gt; issues and create a new file 2022-02.njk
Add the latest issue using the format from the past issues.
