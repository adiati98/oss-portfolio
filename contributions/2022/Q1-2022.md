## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of sending it out. Currently, we're moving them over "by hand."

You can look at the existing newsletters ( src > newsletter > issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs to be updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items.

## Steps to update
You can look at the existing newsletters ( src > newsletter > issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs to be updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items.

In the code base, navigate to src > newsletter > issues and create a new file 2022-03.njk
Add the latest issue using the format from the past issues.
If you have questions, please let us know. We're up for pairing if anyone wants to walk through this!</td>

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of sending it out. Currently, we're moving them over "by hand."

You can look at the existing newsletters ( src > newsletter > issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs to be updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items.

## Steps to update

You can look at the existing newsletters ( src > newsletter > issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs to be updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items.

In the code base, navigate to src > newsletter > issues and create a new file 2022-02.njk
Add the latest issue using the format from the past issues.
