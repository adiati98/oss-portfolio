Closes #534 

## Description

- Add March 2022 newsletter to the website.

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

### Additional Context

I know Eddie from Twitter and have been following him since then 😊
Going further in my learning journey, I develop a huge interest in open source.

I did some open source contributions during Hacktoberfest, but I'm still afraid to contribute outside the event.
That's the reason why I want to join this community. To learn much more about open-source with the community and find more courage in contributing to more open source.</td>

You can look at the existing newsletters ( src > newsletter > issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs to be updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items.

      <td>## Description
- add the functionality to the images gallery. 
- When you click one of the thumbnails, the "big" picture will change to be the same as the clicked thumbnail.
## Process

1. add state to manage which image should be rendered to the UI
2. add a click listener to change the state depending on the thumbnail clicked
3. refactor the code using `array.map()`, to iterate through the thumbnails
4. move the array of images(thumbnails) to `data.js` instead of the component
## Testing steps

1. run npm start
2. click one of the thumbnails to change the big image
