### Additional Context

I know Eddie from Twitter and have been following him since then ðŸ˜Š
Going further in my learning journey, I develop a huge interest in open source.

I did some open source contributions during Hacktoberfest, but I'm still afraid to contribute outside the event.
That's the reason why I want to join this community. To learn much more about open-source with the community and find more courage in contributing to more open source.</td>
