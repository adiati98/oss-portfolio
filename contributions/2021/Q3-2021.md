In the [Table of Contents section in CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#table-of-contents), the link to &quot;Install and Run&quot; (see attached screenshot) goes nowhere.
It's because that link changed to &quot;[Local development](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development)&quot;.

This would be a good first issue for those who start to get their hands wet in open source!

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of sending it out. Currently, we're moving them over &quot;by hand.&quot;

You can look at the existing newsletters ( src &gt; newsletter &gt; issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items.
Steps to update

You can look at the existing newsletters ( src &gt; newsletter &gt; issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items
