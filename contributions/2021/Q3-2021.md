### What happened?

In the [Table of Contents section in CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#table-of-contents), the link to "Install and Run" (see attached screenshot) goes nowhere.
It's because that link changed to "[Local development](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development)".

This would be a good first issue for those who start to get their hands wet in open source!
