- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

There is a typo in the markdown to the link to YouTube.

![typo-markdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45172775/134976865-5300c63e-5bcf-4d5a-8f78-9280e301c626.jpg)
.

### Steps To Reproduce

Go to [Virtual Coffee Events](https://virtualcoffee.io/member-resources/guide-to-vc/#virtual-coffee-events), in the Lightning Talks session.

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

### Environment

### Anything else?

I would like to be assigned to tackle this issue.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

In the [Table of Contents section in CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#table-of-contents), the link to &quot;Install and Run&quot; (see attached screenshot) goes nowhere.
It's because that link changed to &quot;[Local development](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development)&quot;.

This would be a good first issue for those who start to get their hands wet in open source!

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

We now have a [Member Resources section](https://virtualcoffee.io/member-resources/) on the site. The [Slack section](https://virtualcoffee.io/member-resources/guide-to-vc/#vc-slack) has a few interesting channels which is great, but we've always wanted a Slack channel guide. 


### Proposed solution

This should be a new page that is purely the channel guide. We can link to it from other sections, and it will show up in the index. We can model this after the Slack section of the VC Guide, or come up with some new styles.
