      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose. 

&lt;!-- What does this code change? Why did I choose this approach? Did I learn anything worth sharing? Reminder: This will be a publicly facing representation of your work (READ: help you land that sweet dev gig). --&gt;

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

      <td>## Issue

We have found that for Windows users, the `highlight yaml` cannot be previewed correctly as below examples.

As appeared on the website:

![2021-11-09 21 43 37 docs drone io 96f5f4e1746e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45172775/141009965-3bbb177c-92ae-4101-98b4-b3e29fc460be.png)

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR created a welcoming prompt to add a new user's first item if the list is empty to help the user gets oriented to how the app works.
The code changes the way the new user navigates to add item page for UX purposes.

@fatima-ola & @adiati98 learned how to route to a page on click event, which is using the `useHistory().push` method from `react-router-dom`.

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

![2021-11-09 21 43 37 docs drone io 96f5f4e1746e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45172775/141009965-3bbb177c-92ae-4101-98b4-b3e29fc460be.png)

As appeared on the preview:

![preview-yaml](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45172775/141010161-8d1d9506-e39c-4ac2-aa1a-a13bb9f22e3f.jpg)

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

Following the steps from the issue description.

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose. 

&lt;!-- What does this code change? Why did I choose this approach? Did I learn anything worth sharing? Reminder: This will be a publicly facing representation of your work (READ: help you land that sweet dev gig). --&gt;

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

We have found that for Windows users, the `highlight yaml` cannot be previewed correctly as below examples.

As appeared on the website:

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

We have found that for Windows users, the `highlight yaml` cannot be previewed correctly as below examples.

As appeared on the website:

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

      <td>## Description

This PR created a welcoming prompt to add a new user's first item if the list is empty to help the user gets oriented to how the app works.
The code changes the way the new user navigates to add item page for UX purposes.

@fatima-ola & @adiati98 learned how to route to a page on click event, which is using the `useHistory().push` method from `react-router-dom`.

&lt;!-- What does this code change? Why did I choose this approach? Did I learn anything worth sharing? Reminder: This will be a publicly facing representation of your work (READ: help you land that sweet dev gig). --&gt;

## Related Issue

Closes #7 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- The list view, when there are no items to display, should show a prompt (e.g., a button) for the user to add their first item

&lt;!-- Include AC from the Github issue --&gt;

## Type of Changes

&lt;!-- Put an `✓` for the applicable box: --&gt;

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at `http://localhost:3000/`
- Click the &quot;Create a new list&quot; button.
- The screenshot above appears, and the new user can add an item by clicking the &quot;Add item&quot; button.


&lt;!-- Provide steps the other cohort members and mentors need to follow to properly test your additions. --&gt;

When adding new blog post to the member's monthly challenge page on mobile phone, there is no dates display besides today.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

There are a couple issues to fix with the newsletter subscribe form, found on https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/ (and individual newsletter issues).

The code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk

Running a WAVE test will show three issues:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)

- Missing form label
- Broken ARIA reference
- Fieldset missing legend



### Proposed solution

### Form label:

The form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn't labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text &quot;please leave this field empty&quot; or something like that.

### Broken ARIA reference:

This is simply a typo:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21

`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.

### Fieldset missing legend:

From the WAVE tool:

&gt; If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the &lt;legend&gt;. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. 

In this case, we don't need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.

- [ ] Add label to honeypot field
- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value
- [ ] Remove `fieldset`

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

The logo sponsors section on the home page has some accessibility issues:

![Image 2021-10-13 at 2 28 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/137191853-e14fb96e-9c8c-48d1-af68-ea39b0f685dc.jpg)

- Adjacent links to the same location
- Out of order headings (the title is an `h4` while the &quot;Our Supporters&quot; section is an `h2`

Here's the code that produces that section:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/a77a14b94201467fada05dd3008be922d3459b6c/src/index.njk#L156-L219

I think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`, and style the contents so the whole section isn't pink. I'm open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.

### To fix:

For both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, 

- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `&lt;a&gt;` element
- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent
- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`
- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly

### Steps To Reproduce

Run the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) on https://virtualcoffee.io



### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

_No response_

### Environment

_No response_

### Anything else?

### Why redundant links matter:

&gt; When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.

### Why skipped heading levels matter:

&gt; Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.

Since this site is open-source, we can add a nice &quot;edit on github&quot; link to the footer of every page and allow people to more easily contribute to the site!

      <td>Possible item states are as follows:

* Need to buy soon (fewer than 7 days)
* Need to buy kind of soon (between 7 & 30 days)
* Need to buy not soon (more than 30 days)
* Inactive (when there’s only 1 purchase in the database or the purchase is really out of date [the time that has elapsed since the last purchase is 2x what was estimated])

AC:

* Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
* Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
* Items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
* Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

Notes:

* The criteria for an item being inactive has tripped up teams in the past. It's been re-worded to be more clear, but the gist is that an item is inactive if the time that has elapsed since its last purchase is twice (or more) what was estimated the last time it was purchased.
* E.g., if the last estimate was 14 days and 28 days have elapsed, the item is considered inactive.
* Teams in the past have also overengineered the solution here by breaking the list out into separate groups, but it should be achievable in a single list where the visual treatment is different based on what category the item falls into.
* Be sure to not only use color to denote how soon the user will need to buy the item, as noted in the wireframe. https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png

* How soon are you likely to buy it again?
  * Soon (in the next 7 days)
  * Kind of soon (in the next 14 days)
  * Not soon (in the next 30 days)
* Last purchased date

AC:

* User is presented with a form that allows them to enter the name of the item and select how soon they anticipate needing to buy it again (Soon, Kind of Soon, Not Soon)
* When the user submits the form, the item is saved to the database, associated with the user’s token
* Along with the item name, an integer corresponding to the estimated number of days until next purchase is saved: `7` for “Soon”, `14` for “Kind of Soon”, and `30` for “Not Soon”
* The last purchased date should be set to `null` initially (i.e. you can create an item without purchasing it)
* Item names should be displayed as a simple, unordered list on the list view after they’re added

Notes:

* The add item form has the potential to be a lot of scope. The wireframe https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/add-item.png has several notes related to accessibility and UX.
* Eventually, the list will look like the following wireframe: https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png
* It's good for your team to look at the wireframe now, but be sure not to try to implement all of the visible functionality at once. There will be future stories to add all of those features.
* For this story, it's sufficient just to get a simple list of the items displaying.</td>

Notes:

* Don't do too much here. In past, pairs have built the whole add item form in the first week. The best approach is just to make a throw away view with a `&lt;button/&gt;` and a `&lt;div/&gt;`. Click the `&lt;button/&gt;` to send some data to the database. Have the data show up in the `&lt;div/&gt;`. Simple!

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

There are a couple issues to fix with the newsletter subscribe form, found on https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/ (and individual newsletter issues).

The code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk

Running a WAVE test will show three issues:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)

- Missing form label
- Broken ARIA reference
- Fieldset missing legend



### Proposed solution

### Form label:

The form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn't labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text &quot;please leave this field empty&quot; or something like that.

### Broken ARIA reference:

This is simply a typo:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21

`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.

### Fieldset missing legend:

From the WAVE tool:

&gt; If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the &lt;legend&gt;. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. 

In this case, we don't need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.

- [ ] Add label to honeypot field
- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value
- [ ] Remove `fieldset`

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

### What happened?

The logo sponsors section on the home page has some accessibility issues:

![Image 2021-10-13 at 2 28 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/137191853-e14fb96e-9c8c-48d1-af68-ea39b0f685dc.jpg)

- Adjacent links to the same location
- Out of order headings (the title is an `h4` while the &quot;Our Supporters&quot; section is an `h2`

Here's the code that produces that section:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/a77a14b94201467fada05dd3008be922d3459b6c/src/index.njk#L156-L219

I think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`, and style the contents so the whole section isn't pink. I'm open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.

### To fix:

For both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, 

- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `&lt;a&gt;` element
- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent
- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`
- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly

### Steps To Reproduce

Run the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) on https://virtualcoffee.io



### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

_No response_

### Environment

_No response_

### Anything else?

### Why redundant links matter:

&gt; When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.

### Why skipped heading levels matter:

&gt; Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.

      <td>Possible item states are as follows:

* Need to buy soon (fewer than 7 days)
* Need to buy kind of soon (between 7 & 30 days)
* Need to buy not soon (more than 30 days)
* Inactive (when there’s only 1 purchase in the database or the purchase is really out of date [the time that has elapsed since the last purchase is 2x what was estimated])

AC:

* Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
* Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
* Items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
* Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

Notes:

* The criteria for an item being inactive has tripped up teams in the past. It's been re-worded to be more clear, but the gist is that an item is inactive if the time that has elapsed since its last purchase is twice (or more) what was estimated the last time it was purchased.
* E.g., if the last estimate was 14 days and 28 days have elapsed, the item is considered inactive.
* Teams in the past have also overengineered the solution here by breaking the list out into separate groups, but it should be achievable in a single list where the visual treatment is different based on what category the item falls into.
* Be sure to not only use color to denote how soon the user will need to buy the item, as noted in the wireframe. https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png

  * Soon (in the next 7 days)

  * Not soon (in the next 30 days)
* Last purchased date

AC:

* User is presented with a form that allows them to enter the name of the item and select how soon they anticipate needing to buy it again (Soon, Kind of Soon, Not Soon)
* When the user submits the form, the item is saved to the database, associated with the user’s token
* Along with the item name, an integer corresponding to the estimated number of days until next purchase is saved: `7` for “Soon”, `14` for “Kind of Soon”, and `30` for “Not Soon”
* The last purchased date should be set to `null` initially (i.e. you can create an item without purchasing it)
* Item names should be displayed as a simple, unordered list on the list view after they’re added

Notes:

* The add item form has the potential to be a lot of scope. The wireframe https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/add-item.png has several notes related to accessibility and UX.
* Eventually, the list will look like the following wireframe: https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png
* It's good for your team to look at the wireframe now, but be sure not to try to implement all of the visible functionality at once. There will be future stories to add all of those features.
* For this story, it's sufficient just to get a simple list of the items displaying.</td>

Notes:

* Don't do too much here. In past, pairs have built the whole add item form in the first week. The best approach is just to make a throw away view with a `&lt;button/&gt;` and a `&lt;div/&gt;`.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

There are a couple issues to fix with the newsletter subscribe form, found on https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/ (and individual newsletter issues).

The code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk

Running a WAVE test will show three issues:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)

- Missing form label
- Broken ARIA reference
- Fieldset missing legend



### Proposed solution

### Form label:

The form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn't labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text &quot;please leave this field empty&quot; or something like that.

### Broken ARIA reference:

This is simply a typo:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21

`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.

### Fieldset missing legend:

From the WAVE tool:

&gt; If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the &lt;legend&gt;. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. 

In this case, we don't need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.

- [ ] Add label to honeypot field
- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value
- [ ] Remove `fieldset`

### What happened?

The logo sponsors section on the home page has some accessibility issues:

![Image 2021-10-13 at 2 28 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/137191853-e14fb96e-9c8c-48d1-af68-ea39b0f685dc.jpg)

- Adjacent links to the same location
- Out of order headings (the title is an `h4` while the &quot;Our Supporters&quot; section is an `h2`

Here's the code that produces that section:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/a77a14b94201467fada05dd3008be922d3459b6c/src/index.njk#L156-L219

I think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`, and style the contents so the whole section isn't pink. I'm open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.

### To fix:

For both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, 

- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `&lt;a&gt;` element
- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent
- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`
- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly

### Steps To Reproduce

Run the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) on https://virtualcoffee.io



### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

### Environment

_No response_

### Anything else?

### Why redundant links matter:

&gt; When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.

### Why skipped heading levels matter:

&gt; Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.

      <td>Possible item states are as follows:

* Need to buy soon (fewer than 7 days)
* Need to buy kind of soon (between 7 & 30 days)
* Need to buy not soon (more than 30 days)
* Inactive (when there’s only 1 purchase in the database or the purchase is really out of date [the time that has elapsed since the last purchase is 2x what was estimated])

AC:

* Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
* Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
* Items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
* Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

Notes:

* The criteria for an item being inactive has tripped up teams in the past. It's been re-worded to be more clear, but the gist is that an item is inactive if the time that has elapsed since its last purchase is twice (or more) what was estimated the last time it was purchased.
* E.g., if the last estimate was 14 days and 28 days have elapsed, the item is considered inactive.
* Teams in the past have also overengineered the solution here by breaking the list out into separate groups, but it should be achievable in a single list where the visual treatment is different based on what category the item falls into.
* Be sure to not only use color to denote how soon the user will need to buy the item, as noted in the wireframe. https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png

  * Soon (in the next 7 days)

  * Not soon (in the next 30 days)
* Last purchased date

AC:

* User is presented with a form that allows them to enter the name of the item and select how soon they anticipate needing to buy it again (Soon, Kind of Soon, Not Soon)
* When the user submits the form, the item is saved to the database, associated with the user’s token
* Along with the item name, an integer corresponding to the estimated number of days until next purchase is saved: `7` for “Soon”, `14` for “Kind of Soon”, and `30` for “Not Soon”
* The last purchased date should be set to `null` initially (i.e. you can create an item without purchasing it)
* Item names should be displayed as a simple, unordered list on the list view after they’re added

Notes:

* The add item form has the potential to be a lot of scope. The wireframe https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/add-item.png has several notes related to accessibility and UX.
* Eventually, the list will look like the following wireframe: https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png
* It's good for your team to look at the wireframe now, but be sure not to try to implement all of the visible functionality at once. There will be future stories to add all of those features.
* For this story, it's sufficient just to get a simple list of the items displaying.</td>

Notes:

* Don't do too much here. In past, pairs have built the whole add item form in the first week. The best approach is just to make a throw away view with a `&lt;button/&gt;` and a `&lt;div/&gt;`.

The code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk

Running a WAVE test will show three issues:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)

- Missing form label
- Broken ARIA reference
- Fieldset missing legend



### Proposed solution

### Form label:

The form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn't labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text &quot;please leave this field empty&quot; or something like that.

### Broken ARIA reference:

This is simply a typo:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21

`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.

### Fieldset missing legend:

From the WAVE tool:

&gt; If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the &lt;legend&gt;. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. 

In this case, we don't need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.

- [ ] Add label to honeypot field
- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value
- [ ] Remove `fieldset`

### What happened?

The logo sponsors section on the home page has some accessibility issues:

![Image 2021-10-13 at 2 28 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/137191853-e14fb96e-9c8c-48d1-af68-ea39b0f685dc.jpg)

- Adjacent links to the same location
- Out of order headings (the title is an `h4` while the &quot;Our Supporters&quot; section is an `h2`

Here's the code that produces that section:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/a77a14b94201467fada05dd3008be922d3459b6c/src/index.njk#L156-L219

I think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`, and style the contents so the whole section isn't pink. I'm open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.

### To fix:

For both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, 

- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `&lt;a&gt;` element
- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent
- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`
- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly

### Steps To Reproduce

Run the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) on https://virtualcoffee.io

### Environment

_No response_

### Anything else?

### Why redundant links matter:

&gt; When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.

### Why skipped heading levels matter:

&gt; Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.

      <td>Possible item states are as follows:

* Need to buy soon (fewer than 7 days)
* Need to buy kind of soon (between 7 & 30 days)
* Need to buy not soon (more than 30 days)
* Inactive (when there’s only 1 purchase in the database or the purchase is really out of date [the time that has elapsed since the last purchase is 2x what was estimated])

AC:

* Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
* Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
* Items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
* Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

Notes:

* The criteria for an item being inactive has tripped up teams in the past. It's been re-worded to be more clear, but the gist is that an item is inactive if the time that has elapsed since its last purchase is twice (or more) what was estimated the last time it was purchased.
* E.g., if the last estimate was 14 days and 28 days have elapsed, the item is considered inactive.
* Teams in the past have also overengineered the solution here by breaking the list out into separate groups, but it should be achievable in a single list where the visual treatment is different based on what category the item falls into.
* Be sure to not only use color to denote how soon the user will need to buy the item, as noted in the wireframe. https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png

* Last purchased date

AC:

* User is presented with a form that allows them to enter the name of the item and select how soon they anticipate needing to buy it again (Soon, Kind of Soon, Not Soon)
* When the user submits the form, the item is saved to the database, associated with the user’s token
* Along with the item name, an integer corresponding to the estimated number of days until next purchase is saved: `7` for “Soon”, `14` for “Kind of Soon”, and `30` for “Not Soon”
* The last purchased date should be set to `null` initially (i.e. you can create an item without purchasing it)
* Item names should be displayed as a simple, unordered list on the list view after they’re added

Notes:

* The add item form has the potential to be a lot of scope. The wireframe https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/add-item.png has several notes related to accessibility and UX.
* Eventually, the list will look like the following wireframe: https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png
* It's good for your team to look at the wireframe now, but be sure not to try to implement all of the visible functionality at once. There will be future stories to add all of those features.
* For this story, it's sufficient just to get a simple list of the items displaying.</td>

Notes:

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

There are a couple issues to fix with the newsletter subscribe form, found on https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/ (and individual newsletter issues).

The code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk

Running a WAVE test will show three issues:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)

- Missing form label
- Broken ARIA reference
- Fieldset missing legend



### Proposed solution

### Form label:

The form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn't labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text &quot;please leave this field empty&quot; or something like that.

### Broken ARIA reference:

This is simply a typo:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21

`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.

### Fieldset missing legend:

From the WAVE tool:

&gt; If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the &lt;legend&gt;. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. 

In this case, we don't need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.

- [ ] Add label to honeypot field
- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value
- [ ] Remove `fieldset`

I think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`, and style the contents so the whole section isn't pink. I'm open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.

### To fix:

For both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, 

- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `&lt;a&gt;` element
- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent
- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`
- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly

### Steps To Reproduce

### Anything else?

### Why redundant links matter:

&gt; When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.

### Why skipped heading levels matter:

&gt; Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.

This approach is laid out pretty clearly on the 11ty docs (don't tell anyone but this is where I got the idea...)

      <td>Possible item states are as follows:

* Need to buy soon (fewer than 7 days)
* Need to buy kind of soon (between 7 & 30 days)
* Need to buy not soon (more than 30 days)
* Inactive (when there’s only 1 purchase in the database or the purchase is really out of date [the time that has elapsed since the last purchase is 2x what was estimated])

AC:

* Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
* Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
* Items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
* Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

Notes:

* The criteria for an item being inactive has tripped up teams in the past. It's been re-worded to be more clear, but the gist is that an item is inactive if the time that has elapsed since its last purchase is twice (or more) what was estimated the last time it was purchased.
* E.g., if the last estimate was 14 days and 28 days have elapsed, the item is considered inactive.
* Teams in the past have also overengineered the solution here by breaking the list out into separate groups, but it should be achievable in a single list where the visual treatment is different based on what category the item falls into.
* Be sure to not only use color to denote how soon the user will need to buy the item, as noted in the wireframe. https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png

AC:

* User is presented with a form that allows them to enter the name of the item and select how soon they anticipate needing to buy it again (Soon, Kind of Soon, Not Soon)
* When the user submits the form, the item is saved to the database, associated with the user’s token
* Along with the item name, an integer corresponding to the estimated number of days until next purchase is saved: `7` for “Soon”, `14` for “Kind of Soon”, and `30` for “Not Soon”
* The last purchased date should be set to `null` initially (i.e. you can create an item without purchasing it)
* Item names should be displayed as a simple, unordered list on the list view after they’re added

Notes:

* The add item form has the potential to be a lot of scope. The wireframe https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/add-item.png has several notes related to accessibility and UX.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

There are a couple issues to fix with the newsletter subscribe form, found on https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/ (and individual newsletter issues).

The code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk

Running a WAVE test will show three issues:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)

- Missing form label
- Broken ARIA reference
- Fieldset missing legend



### Proposed solution

### Form label:

The form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn't labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text &quot;please leave this field empty&quot; or something like that.

### Broken ARIA reference:

This is simply a typo:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21

`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.

### Fieldset missing legend:

From the WAVE tool:

&gt; If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the &lt;legend&gt;. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. 

In this case, we don't need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.

- [ ] Add label to honeypot field
- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value
- [ ] Remove `fieldset`

### What happened?

The logo sponsors section on the home page has some accessibility issues:

![Image 2021-10-13 at 2 28 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/137191853-e14fb96e-9c8c-48d1-af68-ea39b0f685dc.jpg)

- Adjacent links to the same location
- Out of order headings (the title is an `h4` while the &quot;Our Supporters&quot; section is an `h2`

Here's the code that produces that section:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/a77a14b94201467fada05dd3008be922d3459b6c/src/index.njk#L156-L219

I think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`, and style the contents so the whole section isn't pink. I'm open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.

### To fix:

For both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, 

- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `&lt;a&gt;` element
- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent
- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`
- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

### Environment

### Anything else?

### Why redundant links matter:

&gt; When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.

### Why skipped heading levels matter:

&gt; Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.

Since this site is open-source, we can add a nice &quot;edit on github&quot; link to the footer of every page and allow people to more easily contribute to the site!

### Proposed solution

This approach is laid out pretty clearly on the 11ty docs (don't tell anyone but this is where I got the idea...)

- [Add Edit on GitHub Links to All Pages](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/edit-on-github-links/)

We'd want a link in the footer of each page:

      <td>Possible item states are as follows:

* Need to buy soon (fewer than 7 days)
* Need to buy kind of soon (between 7 & 30 days)
* Need to buy not soon (more than 30 days)
* Inactive (when there’s only 1 purchase in the database or the purchase is really out of date [the time that has elapsed since the last purchase is 2x what was estimated])

AC:

* Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
* Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
* Items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
* Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

Notes:

* The criteria for an item being inactive has tripped up teams in the past. It's been re-worded to be more clear, but the gist is that an item is inactive if the time that has elapsed since its last purchase is twice (or more) what was estimated the last time it was purchased.
* E.g., if the last estimate was 14 days and 28 days have elapsed, the item is considered inactive.
* Teams in the past have also overengineered the solution here by breaking the list out into separate groups, but it should be achievable in a single list where the visual treatment is different based on what category the item falls into.
* Be sure to not only use color to denote how soon the user will need to buy the item, as noted in the wireframe. https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png

  * Soon (in the next 7 days)

* Last purchased date

AC:

* User is presented with a form that allows them to enter the name of the item and select how soon they anticipate needing to buy it again (Soon, Kind of Soon, Not Soon)
* When the user submits the form, the item is saved to the database, associated with the user’s token
* Along with the item name, an integer corresponding to the estimated number of days until next purchase is saved: `7` for “Soon”, `14` for “Kind of Soon”, and `30` for “Not Soon”
* The last purchased date should be set to `null` initially (i.e. you can create an item without purchasing it)
* Item names should be displayed as a simple, unordered list on the list view after they’re added

Notes:

* The add item form has the potential to be a lot of scope. The wireframe https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/add-item.png has several notes related to accessibility and UX.
* Eventually, the list will look like the following wireframe: https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png
* It's good for your team to look at the wireframe now, but be sure not to try to implement all of the visible functionality at once. There will be future stories to add all of those features.
* For this story, it's sufficient just to get a simple list of the items displaying.</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

There are a couple issues to fix with the newsletter subscribe form, found on https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/ (and individual newsletter issues).

The code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk

Running a WAVE test will show three issues:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)

- Missing form label
- Broken ARIA reference
- Fieldset missing legend



### Proposed solution

### Form label:

The form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn't labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text &quot;please leave this field empty&quot; or something like that.

### Broken ARIA reference:

This is simply a typo:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21

`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.

### Fieldset missing legend:

From the WAVE tool:

&gt; If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the &lt;legend&gt;. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. 

In this case, we don't need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.

- [ ] Add label to honeypot field
- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value
- [ ] Remove `fieldset`

### What happened?

The logo sponsors section on the home page has some accessibility issues:

![Image 2021-10-13 at 2 28 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/137191853-e14fb96e-9c8c-48d1-af68-ea39b0f685dc.jpg)

- Adjacent links to the same location
- Out of order headings (the title is an `h4` while the &quot;Our Supporters&quot; section is an `h2`

Here's the code that produces that section:

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/a77a14b94201467fada05dd3008be922d3459b6c/src/index.njk#L156-L219

I think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`, and style the contents so the whole section isn't pink. I'm open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.

### To fix:

For both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, 

- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `&lt;a&gt;` element
- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent
- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`
- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly

### Steps To Reproduce

Run the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) on https://virtualcoffee.io



### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

_No response_

### Environment

_No response_

### Anything else?

### Why redundant links matter:

&gt; When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.

### Why skipped heading levels matter:

&gt; Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.

* E.g., if the last estimate was 14 days and 28 days have elapsed, the item is considered inactive.
* Teams in the past have also overengineered the solution here by breaking the list out into separate groups, but it should be achievable in a single list where the visual treatment is different based on what category the item falls into.
* Be sure to not only use color to denote how soon the user will need to buy the item, as noted in the wireframe. https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png
* Good luck, you got this!</td>

      <td>AC:

* The list view, when there are no items to display, should show a prompt (e.g., a button) for the user to add their first item

Notes:

* The wireframe is a little short on the &quot;welcoming&quot; part of the story, but otherwise is functionally complete for the purposes of the AC. https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-empty.png</td>

      <td>A shopping list item consists of the following data points:

* Name of item
* How soon are you likely to buy it again?
  * Soon (in the next 7 days)
  * Kind of soon (in the next 14 days)
  * Not soon (in the next 30 days)
* Last purchased date

AC:

* User is presented with a form that allows them to enter the name of the item and select how soon they anticipate needing to buy it again (Soon, Kind of Soon, Not Soon)
* When the user submits the form, the item is saved to the database, associated with the user’s token
* Along with the item name, an integer corresponding to the estimated number of days until next purchase is saved: `7` for “Soon”, `14` for “Kind of Soon”, and `30` for “Not Soon”
* The last purchased date should be set to `null` initially (i.e. you can create an item without purchasing it)
* Item names should be displayed as a simple, unordered list on the list view after they’re added

Notes:

* The add item form has the potential to be a lot of scope. The wireframe https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/add-item.png has several notes related to accessibility and UX.
* Eventually, the list will look like the following wireframe: https://github.com/the-collab-lab/smart-shopping-list/blob/main/_resources/wireframes/list-populated.png
* It's good for your team to look at the wireframe now, but be sure not to try to implement all of the visible functionality at once. There will be future stories to add all of those features.
* For this story, it's sufficient just to get a simple list of the items displaying.</td>

      <td>This is 1 of 2 stories that should be completed in the first week to enable further development of the app.

AC:

* The following have been added as project dependencies: `firebase` & `react-firebase-hooks`
* Make a change in the Firestore database and it shows up in the app
* Make a change in the app and it shows up in the Firestore database

Notes:

* Don't do too much here. In past, pairs have built the whole add item form in the first week. The best approach is just to make a throw away view with a `&lt;button/&gt;` and a `&lt;div/&gt;`. Click the `&lt;button/&gt;` to send some data to the database. Have the data show up in the `&lt;div/&gt;`. Simple!
* Also, if you need more direction on how to use `react-firebase-hooks`, you can reference this commit from Alejandro: https://github.com/alejandronanez/smart-shopping-list-demo/commit/d590adc3224872e71d000c41977a1b7a84542c31 and/or watch this Loom video where he explains how it works: https://www.loom.com/share/0dffa1a63bf24b449d6565c76606bbd9</td>
