      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose. 

<!-- What does this code change? Why did I choose this approach? Did I learn anything worth sharing? Reminder: This will be a publicly facing representation of your work (READ: help you land that sweet dev gig). -->

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

<!-- If you write "closes" followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

<!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots -->


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -> 7 days
   - Yellow -> 14 days
   - Purple -> 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `<span>` inside the `<label>` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `<span class="hide-span" aria-label="Buy Chocolate every 14 days">Chocolate</span>`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

      <td>## Issue

We have found that for Windows users, the `highlight yaml` cannot be previewed correctly as below examples.

As appeared on the website:

![2021-11-09 21 43 37 docs drone io 96f5f4e1746e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45172775/141009965-3bbb177c-92ae-4101-98b4-b3e29fc460be.png)

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the "create a new list" button
- Click the "add item" button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the "Add Item" button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool > the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

### What happened?

When adding new blog post to the member's monthly challenge page on mobile phone, there is no dates display besides today.

However, when we click on a date blindly, it does give focus on the date and we can still add backdated posts.

### Steps To Reproduce

From mobile phone:
1. After sign in to members'page, click the "Check out the Monthly Challenges".
2. Click "Add your blog posts!"
3. Click "Add New Post!"
4. Click on Date Published and you will see this page
