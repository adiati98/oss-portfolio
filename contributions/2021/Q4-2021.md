      <td>Please help improve the transcript for this episode.<br><br>- You can either listen to the episode and improve the transcript based on what you hear.<br>- Another option is to read through the transcript and improve it purely based on the issues you detect when reading it.<br>- You do not have to improve the complete transcript. You can also only work on half of it.<br>- Every little help to make the podcast more accessible is awesome.<br>- If you need help, please feel free to reach out to me<br><br>BTW, the transcript has an intentional ~80-chars max line wrap (i.e., a new line starts after max 80 chars). Please keep it in that format. Thank you</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?<br><br>- [X] I have searched the existing issues<br><br>### Issue Context<br><br>There are a couple issues to fix with the newsletter subscribe form, found on https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/ (and individual newsletter issues).<br><br>The code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk<br><br>Running a WAVE test will show three issues:<br><br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)<br><br>- Missing form label<br>- Broken ARIA reference<br>- Fieldset missing legend<br><br><br><br>### Proposed solution<br><br>### Form label:<br><br>The form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn&#39;t labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text &quot;please leave this field empty&quot; or something like that.<br><br>### Broken ARIA reference:<br><br>This is simply a typo:<br><br>https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21<br><br>`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.<br><br>### Fieldset missing legend:<br><br>From the WAVE tool:<br><br>&gt; If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the &lt;legend&gt;. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. <br><br>In this case, we don&#39;t need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.<br><br>- [ ] Add label to honeypot field<br>- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value<br>- [ ] Remove `fieldset`<br><br><br><br>### Alternatives Considered<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Additional Resources<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [X] I&#39;ve read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?<br><br>- [X] I have searched the existing issues<br><br>### What happened?<br><br>The logo sponsors section on the home page has some accessibility issues:<br><br>![Image 2021-10-13 at 2 28 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/137191853-e14fb96e-9c8c-48d1-af68-ea39b0f685dc.jpg)<br><br>- Adjacent links to the same location<br>- Out of order headings (the title is an `h4` while the &quot;Our Supporters&quot; section is an `h2`<br><br>Here&#39;s the code that produces that section:<br><br>https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/a77a14b94201467fada05dd3008be922d3459b6c/src/index.njk#L156-L219<br><br>I think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`, and style the contents so the whole section isn&#39;t pink. I&#39;m open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.<br><br>### To fix:<br><br>For both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, <br><br>- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `&lt;a&gt;` element<br>- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent<br>- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=&quot;&quot;`<br>- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly<br><br>### Steps To Reproduce<br><br>Run the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) on https://virtualcoffee.io<br><br><br><br>### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Environment<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Anything else?<br><br>### Why redundant links matter:<br><br>&gt; When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.<br><br>### Why skipped heading levels matter:<br><br>&gt; Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [X] I&#39;ve read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community</td>
