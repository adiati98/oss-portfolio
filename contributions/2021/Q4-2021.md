      <td>Please help improve the transcript for this episode.<br><br>- You can either listen to the episode and improve the transcript based on what you hear.<br>- Another option is to read through the transcript and improve it purely based on the issues you detect when reading it.<br>- You do not have to improve the complete transcript. You can also only work on half of it.<br>- Every little help to make the podcast more accessible is awesome.<br>- If you need help, please feel free to reach out to me<br><br>BTW, the transcript has an intentional ~80-chars max line wrap (i.e., a new line starts after max 80 chars). Please keep it in that format. Thank you</td>
