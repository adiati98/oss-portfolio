Our podcast's transcriptions are automatically generated, so there would be typos or missing words. 

We want to improve every episode's transcription so they can be accessible for everyone. Currently, we are doing this manually.

To keep the consistency throughout the transcripts we need to have a guideline of transcription.

### Context for content change

I noticed that our podcast episodes have automatically generated transcriptions.
There are typos in every episode.  

### Proposed solution

To make it more accessible, we can manually edit the transcriptions based on the W3C guidance for [transcribing audio to text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcribing/).

### What happened?

When adding new blog post to the member's monthly challenge page on mobile phone, there is no dates display besides today.

However, when we click on a date blindly, it does give focus on the date and we can still add backdated posts.

### Steps To Reproduce

From mobile phone:
1. After sign in to members'page, click the "Check out the Monthly Challenges".
2. Click "Add your blog posts!"
3. Click "Add New Post!"
4. Click on Date Published and you will see this page

## Description

<!-- What does this code change? Why did I choose this approach? Did I learn anything worth sharing? Reminder: This will be a publicly facing representation of your work (READ: help you land that sweet dev gig). -->
This code allows users to delete an item from the shopping list so that their list isn’t cluttered with items they don’t want to buy in the future. The filter method approach was used because we have arrays of objects to loop through and check if an item is to be deleted or not. Yes we learnt how to use `filter()` method, `window.confirm()` method and how to delete a particular item from firestore database.

## Related Issue
closes #11 

<!-- If you write "closes" followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Include AC from the Github issue -->

- The user is able to delete an item from the shopping list
- Before deleting, prompt the user to confirm that they really want to delete the item to prevent accidental deletions
- Deletion should cause the associated record(s) in the database to be deleted

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

<!-- Provide steps the other cohort members and mentors need to follow to properly test your additions. -->

- Pull the branch to your machine
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the project on the browser `localhost:3000`
- If a list pops up, click on the delete button to delete, click yes to confirm and the item will be deleted. You can reload your page to confirm that it is deleted from the database as well. To be sure, after reloading the list of items appears without the deleted items.
- If you click cancel, the item will not be deleted.
- If you don't have any existing items, you can create a new item and add items to view all the lists on the list page
- Or join an existing list with one of the token here `vale lacy wrist` , `haydn lund lee` , `bunyan sri scour`

Search for items on the shopping list by typing any part of the item name. Pressing on the UI "x" should re-render the list.

## Related Issue

<!-- If you write "closes" followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- Display a text field above the top of the shopping list
- As the user types into the field, the list should narrow to display only items that contain the text the user entered in the filter field
- When the field has text in it, the user should be able to tap a UI element (e.g., with an "X" button next to the field) to clear the field
- The filter text should match any part of the item name (i.e. it should not only match from the start of the string)

## Acceptance Criteria

- User is able to tap a checkbox or similar UI element to mark an item in the list as purchased
- Item should be shown as checked for 24 hours after the purchase is made (i.e. we assume the user does not need to buy the item again for at least 1 day)

## Updates
- Also updated the user interface on first time load. Token is generated in storage, but not immediately sent to the database.
- Fixed input validation bug that previously allowed first entry of a list to be blank. This was caused by two issues: 1) input validation was performed only on lists that was NOT empty,  2) because the local storage token that identifies the list is not immediately sent to database, any input validation on an item of a list that is yet to exist in the database was also circumvented.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Create a new list.
- Add items.
- Check(mark) one/more items on the list.
- Now get out your trusty calculator and do the following: 
1. Check an item, and note the item's `lastPurchase` value is 1634547931018.
2. Dial it back a day: 1634547931018 - 86,400,000. The item should now be unchecked.
3. Add 5 minutes back: 1634547931018 - 86,400,000 + 300,000. The item should now be checked again.</td>

## Description

<!-- What does this code change? Why did I choose this approach? Did I learn anything worth sharing? Reminder: This will be a publicly facing representation of your work (READ: help you land that sweet dev gig). -->

This pull request contains implementation code for a user of the smart shopping list app to navigate between the "list" view and "add an item" view. In this PR , Dana and I (Edema) created components for these views and clearly delineated them from each other with appropriate routing to navigate to each of these views ("list view" and "add an item view"). We installed react-router-dom dependency  and used it for routing. One among the things we learnt in this sprint work was how to collaborate effectively and come up with a working UI.

## Related Issue

<!-- If you write "closes" followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] react-router-dom was added as a project dependency
- [x] Links are present and persistent at the bottom of the app: one for the “list” view, the other for the “add an item” view
- [x] When one of the links is clicked, the browser URL updates to represent the current view and a matching view component is displayed
- [x] Whichever view is selected, the corresponding link is displayed in bold text

<!-- Provide steps the other cohort members and mentors need to follow to properly test your additions. -->
* From your terminal, pull down this branch with `git pull origin dc-eu-add-two-views` and check that branch out with `git checkout dc-eu-add-two-views` 
* Then `npm update or npm install` to install the newly added dependencies locally and `npm start` to launch the app.
cypress tests can be added to check for the availability and display of each UI feature and the appropriate texts and components is displayed on each particular routing. Though tests were not prioritised for this particular implementation stage.
