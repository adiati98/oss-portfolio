      <td>## Issue Context

Our podcast's transcriptions are automatically generated, so there would be typos or missing words. 

We want to improve every episode's transcription so they can be accessible for everyone. Currently, we are doing this manually.

To keep the consistency throughout the transcripts we need to have a guideline of transcription.

You can look at the existing newsletters ( src > newsletter > issues) as a kind of template. The sections are all the same. The content needs to be updated, and sometimes that changes the way things look, for example, your list may have fewer items.

### Context for content change

I noticed that our podcast episodes have automatically generated transcriptions.
There are typos in every episode.  

### Proposed solution

To make it more accessible, we can manually edit the transcriptions based on the W3C guidance for [transcribing audio to text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcribing/).

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When adding new blog post to the member's monthly challenge page on mobile phone, there is no dates display besides today.

However, when we click on a date blindly, it does give focus on the date and we can still add backdated posts.

### Steps To Reproduce

From mobile phone:
1. After sign in to members'page, click the "Check out the Monthly Challenges".
2. Click "Add your blog posts!"
3. Click "Add New Post!"
4. Click on Date Published and you will see this page
