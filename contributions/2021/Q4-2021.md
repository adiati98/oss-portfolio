      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose. 

&lt;!-- What does this code change? Why did I choose this approach? Did I learn anything worth sharing? Reminder: This will be a publicly facing representation of your work (READ: help you land that sweet dev gig). --&gt;

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

      <td>## Issue

We have found that for Windows users, the `highlight yaml` cannot be previewed correctly as below examples.

As appeared on the website:

![2021-11-09 21 43 37 docs drone io 96f5f4e1746e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45172775/141009965-3bbb177c-92ae-4101-98b4-b3e29fc460be.png)

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

      <td>## Issue

We have found that for Windows users, the `highlight yaml` cannot be previewed correctly as below examples.

As appeared on the website:

![2021-11-09 21 43 37 docs drone io 96f5f4e1746e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45172775/141009965-3bbb177c-92ae-4101-98b4-b3e29fc460be.png)

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

## Description

Update Virtual Coffee's Slack channel guide to current channels.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

We have found that for Windows users, the `highlight yaml` cannot be previewed correctly as below examples.

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

      <td>## Description

This PR adds several functionalities:
- Sorting items by the estimated number of days until the next purchase.
- Sorting items with the same number of estimated days until next purchase alphabetically.
- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

## Related Issue

Closes #12 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

We have found that for Windows users, the `highlight yaml` cannot be previewed correctly as below examples.

As appeared on the website:

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

      <td>## Description

This PR created a welcoming prompt to add a new user's first item if the list is empty to help the user gets oriented to how the app works.
The code changes the way the new user navigates to add item page for UX purposes.

@fatima-ola & @adiati98 learned how to route to a page on click event, which is using the `useHistory().push` method from `react-router-dom`.

&lt;!-- What does this code change? Why did I choose this approach? Did I learn anything worth sharing? Reminder: This will be a publicly facing representation of your work (READ: help you land that sweet dev gig). --&gt;

## Related Issue

Closes #7 

&lt;!-- If you write &quot;closes&quot; followed by the Github issue number, it will automatically close the issue for you when the PR merges --&gt;

## Acceptance Criteria

- The list view, when there are no items to display, should show a prompt (e.g., a button) for the user to add their first item

&lt;!-- Include AC from the Github issue --&gt;

- Add background color to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for visual distinction.
- Add `aria-label` to each item based on their `nextPurchase` days for accessibility purpose.

- Items in the list are shown as visually distinct (e.g., with a different background color on the list item) according to how soon the item is expected to be bought again: Soon, Kind of soon, Not soon, Inactive
- Items should be sorted by the estimated number of days until the next purchase
- Items with the same number of estimated days until the next purchase should be sorted alphabetically
- Items in the different states should be described distinctly when read by a screen reader

&lt;!-- If UI feature, take provide screenshots --&gt;


## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run npm start
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Enter a token from Firebase to join the existing list or create a new list and add several items.
  By now we should already see the background color for each item based on their `nextPurchase`.
   - Green -&gt; 7 days
   - Yellow -&gt; 14 days
   - Purple -&gt; 30 days
- Open browser's devtools.
- Inspect the `&lt;span&gt;` inside the `&lt;label&gt;` of `input checkbox` to check the `aria-label`.
  Here we will see something like  `&lt;span class=&quot;hide-span&quot; aria-label=&quot;Buy Chocolate every 14 days&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;`.
- Go to Firebase.
- Rollback the date of `lastPurchase` on an item.
- Go to our application and check that item again.
  The expected behavior is that the list is now sorted based on the `estimatedPurchaseInterval`. And items with the same `estimatedPurchaseInterval` are sorted alphabetically.

## Methodology

We don't find any solution yet for this issue which is coming from Hugo.
So we tried to preview with WSL which works perfectly.

## Suggestion

We include a suggestion on the README file for Windows users to preview this with WSL.

## Testing Steps / QA Criteria

- Pull the branch.
- Run `npm start`
- Launch the browser to preview at http://localhost:3000/
- Click the &quot;create a new list&quot; button
- Click the &quot;add item&quot; button
- Add an item, select how soon to buy the item, click the &quot;Add Item&quot; button.
- Navigate to the List page and open `developer's tool &gt; the Application tab` to see the generated three words token.
- Go to Firebase and open the document with the generated three words token as you see on the Application tab.
  Here you will see new fields of `estimatedPurchaseInterval: null` and `totalPurchase: 0`.
- Check the item on the List page and get back to the Firebase.
  The expected behavior is `totalPurchase` will be added by 1.
- Subtract the `lastPurchase` to uncheck the checklist.
- Go to the List and check the item again.
- Go back to Firebase.
  Now you should see that the `totalPurchase` is updated and `estimatedPurchaseInterval` starts estimating days of the next purchase and gets recorded in the database.

If you have a pull request related to a current issue please link to that issue number.

That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword &quot;Closes&quot; followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

## Description

Add November 2021 November Newsletter to the website.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

Following the steps from the issue description.

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

### Context for content change

I noticed that our podcast episodes have automatically generated transcriptions.
There are typos in every episode.  

### Proposed solution

To make it more accessible, we can manually edit the transcriptions based on the W3C guidance for [transcribing audio to text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcribing/).

When adding new blog post to the member's monthly challenge page on mobile phone, there is no dates display besides today.

- Open the file of the podcast's episode. 
  e.g.: `1_0.srt` means season 1 episode 0
-  Listen to the podcast's episode and improve the transcript based on what you hear.

### Context for content change

I noticed that our podcast episodes have automatically generated transcriptions.
There are typos in every episode.  

### Proposed solution

To make it more accessible, we can manually edit the transcriptions based on the W3C guidance for [transcribing audio to text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcribing/).

_No response_

### Context for content change

I noticed that our podcast episodes have automatically generated transcriptions.
There are typos in every episode.  

### Proposed solution

To make it more accessible, we can manually edit the transcriptions based on the W3C guidance for [transcribing audio to text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcribing/).

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When adding new blog post to the member's monthly challenge page on mobile phone, there is no dates display besides today.

However, when we click on a date blindly, it does give focus on the date and we can still add backdated posts.

### Steps To Reproduce

From mobile phone:
1. After sign in to members'page, click the &quot;Check out the Monthly Challenges&quot;.
2. Click &quot;Add your blog posts!&quot;
3. Click &quot;Add New Post!&quot;
4. Click on Date Published and you will see this page
