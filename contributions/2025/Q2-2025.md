A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

Currently, most of suggestions from Vale are to confirm if a word is a Mautic feature. This cause us to apply many `vale off` and `vale on` across the docs, while the terms are barely used in this Community Handbook.

## Suggestion

Remove &quot;Mautic&quot; from the `BasedOnStyle` in `.vale.ini` file as below:

https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/8c29c216135c7792c953798bddd05a4478e0ba66/.vale.ini#L5 </td>

      <td>## Description

Based on [this comment](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/issues/15081#issuecomment-2955751016), we need to remove the `bin/console doctrine:schema:update --no-interaction --force` from the docs in all versions as it's not necessary and quite harmful.

## Proposed Solution

As we need to remove the command from several branches, there should one PR for each branch with the below list:

- [ ] 7.0
- [x] 6.0
- [x] 5.2
- [x] 5.x
- [x] 4.x
- [ ] 3.x

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

There is a &quot;Maintainers&quot; section on the README. This section makes more sense to be part of the &quot;Maintainers&quot; page.

### Proposed solution

- Move the &quot;Maintainers&quot; section from README to the &quot;Maintainers&quot; page.
- Update and adjust the contents in the &quot;Maintainers&quot; page.

      <td>## Description

Let's add resources related to job search for developers. They can be guides, tips, or others.

## How to Add a Resource

- Follow the instructions on the README to [set up your local environment](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io?tab=readme-ov-file#local-development-setup).
- Create a branch.
  
  ```bash
   git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME
  ```
  Change `BRANCH-NAME` to the category of the resource you're adding. For example: `add-interview-resource`.
- Find `src/content/resources/developer-resources/_job-hunt-draft-pages`. There are several files in this folder.
- Choose a proper file to add your resource:
  - **`career-goals-setting-and-progress-tracking.mdx`**: for resources related to career goals setting and applications progress tracking. For example, how to set goals for job searching, recommended tools for progress tracking, etc.
  - **`career-negotiation.mdx`**: for resources related to career negotiation. For example, how to negotiate salary, work/life balance, etc.
  - **`developer-interview-prep.mdx`**: for resources related to interview preparation. For example, elevator pitches, interview questions, dos and don'ts, etc.
  - **`developer-job-boards.mdx`**: for recommended job searching websites.
  - **`developer-networking.mdx`**: for resources related to networking with other developers that can lead to job opportunities.
  - **`developer-personal-brand.mdx`**: for resources related to building a personal brand as a developer. For example, how to update LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, how to make your portfolio stand out for job searches, etc.
  - **`developer-resume.mdx`**: for resources related to resume. For example, how to tailor your resume, recommended websites to create a resume, etc.
- Using Markdown, add the link of your resource in the unordered list.

  ```markdown
  - [Resource Title](URL)
  ```

  For example:
  
  ```markdown
  - [Job Hunt](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/developer-resources/job-hunt)
  ```
- Add and commit your changes.
- Push your branch up to your fork.
- Create a Pull Request. In the &quot;Linked Issue&quot; section, type `Relates to #1353`.</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

Throughout the years, our members shared valuable resources related to job hunting and we lost many great resources as Slack only keeps messages for limited time. We want to compile existing and future resources within the Developer Resources to ease people in finding the job-related resources.

### Proposed solution

Add a &quot;Job Hunt&quot; page with sub-pages to the &quot;Developer Resources&quot;.

## Suggestions

Add the files to the `toctree` in the `index.rst` file. We want to follow the origin structure - with subsections- if it's possible.

In the &quot;Schedule&quot; page, all events have type labels. When running WAVE on this page, the labels' background color red, pink, and green show contrast errors. Below are the screenshots for these colors.

![green label with contrast error](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2771b20b-7ec8-4b2c-9ed6-e1803c78efed)

## Suggestions

Considering that the text color is white, we can adjust the colors to be darker, but not far from the existing color. That way, we can pass the color checker to follow accessibility rules as the below:

### Red label for the &quot;meetup&quot; type

Change the color from `#F42F36` to `#C70A11`.

![red label passes contrast checker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba0952f0-808a-4401-a37b-4b8c1b84cec3)

### Pink label for the &quot;podcast&quot; type

Change the color from `#FA0087` to `E6007A`.

![pink label passes contrast checker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f7a806-1d43-4550-b8ba-8623ec784414)

### Green label for the &quot;talk&quot; type

Change the color from `#1FD19F` to `#138162`.

When running [WAVEhttps://wave.webaim.org/]() on the homepage, it shows one contrast error.
The error comes from the pink background of the podcast label as per screenshot below.

## Suggestion

We can achieve the color contrast for accessibility by changing the background color for the podcast label from `#FA0087` to `E6007A`. It makes the pink slightly darker, but not too far from the existing one.

      <td><a href='https://github.com/github/maintainermonth/issues/272'>Issues with `yarn` on Windows 11</a></td>
      <td>## Description

I forked and cloned the `maintainermonth` repository on my local machine.

I followed the instructions on the `README` to run the project locally. However, I encountered some problems when installing dependencies with `yarn`.

### Environment

- **OS:** Windows 11
- **Yarn version:** v1.22.19
- **Node version:** v20.17.0

## How to reproduce the bug

### `yarn install`

1. Fork and clone the forked `maintainermonth` repository to your local machine.
2. Run `yarn install`.
3. You will get an error message (the path will be different depending on your directory & folder names):

    ```bash
    error An unexpected error occurred: &quot;Unknown token: { line: 1379, col: 1, type: 'INVALID', value: undefined } 1379:1 in D:\\WebDev\\GitHub\\maintainermonth\\yarn.lock&quot;.
    ```

### `yarn start`

When I could finally install the dependencies, running `yarn start` also gave me a problem.

1. Run `yarn start`.
2. You will get an error message (the path will be different depending on your directory & folder names):

    ```bash
    Error: Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory. Try building your app with 'next build' before starting the production server. https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/production-start-no-build-id
    at setupFsCheck (D:\WebDev\GitHub\maintainermonth\node_modules\next\dist\server\lib\router-utils\filesystem.js:151:19)
    at async initialize (D:\WebDev\GitHub\maintainermonth\node_modules\next\dist\server\lib\router-server.js:63:23)
    at async Server.&lt;anonymous&gt; (D:\WebDev\GitHub\maintainermonth\node_modules\next\dist\server\lib\start-server.js:249:36)
    error Command failed with exit code 1.
    ```

### `yarn build`

After running `yarn start`, in the error message, it was mentioned: `Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory. Try building your app with 'next build' before starting the production server.`

So, I followed this instruction as the below:

1. Run `yarn build`.
2. You will get the error message:

    ```bash
    $ NODE_ENV=production next build
    'NODE_ENV' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
    error Command failed with exit code 1.
    ```

## Workaround

I finally could get everything worked as expected with the below workaround:

1. Fork and clone the forked `maintainermonth` repository to the local machine.
2. Remove the `yarn.lock` file.
3. Run `yarn install`.
    
    &gt; Now the dependencies can be installed without any issue, and a new `yarn.lock` file is generated.
4. Run `yarn dev`.
    
    &gt; Running `yarn start` still doesn't work. But `yarn dev` runs and renders the website with no problem.

## Suggestions

Sometimes, Windows users encounter problems that Mac users don't. It'd be great if other Windows users could confirm if this also happened in their machine.

If they encounter the same problem, we might want to update the instructions on the README to accommodate Windows users.

Things to consider:

- Run `yarn dev` instead of `yarn start`
- Recommended `yarn` version if preferable
- Recommended Node version if preferable</td>

      <td><a href='https://github.com/github/maintainermonth/issues/270'>Add CODEOWNERS file</a></td>
      <td>## Description

The `maintainermonth` repo currently doesn't have a `CODEOWNERS` file. Having this file would benefits both maintainers and contributors with the below reasons:

- Whenever there's an issue or PR coming in, maintainers will get notified. That way, all issues and PRs can get attention they need and hardly get missed.

- Contributors don't always know who maintain a repo. In some cases, when there are active/regular contributors, folks are assuming that they are the maintainer of the repo. Maintainers are decision makers who understand the vision and mission of the repo. So it makes more sense to tag the maintainers team when they have questions or ask directions that needs to be aligned with the project's needs. We can then mention this in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` that when folks need to reach out maintainers, they can tag `@github/team-name`.

## Suggestions

Add a `CODEOWNERS` file to the `.github` folder.

Wait until the &quot;Setting up remote connection: Building codespace...&quot; has finished.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce194512-274f-4d26-bf16-66303d4384c8)

Once the codespace has been built, a terminal will open and run some post-creation commands (installing required Python packages and Vale). This step is quick.

Next, open any .rst file and click the Preview button at the top right.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ade075a-f62b-47f7-ab60-e0481a5d10d2)

The preview window will open, but it won’t work. [See here](https://docs.esbon.io/en/latest/lsp/getting-started.html#open-a-preview)
There’s a workaround: opening the preview triggers the Esbonio server to start. Then, under the Ports tab, you’ll see a URL that you can use to view the documentation. Click either of the two buttons - the first opens it in the browser, the second opens it in the editor.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d3d86d5-acb2-4fc8-abcd-0bca761b2572)

When viewing via the URL, you’ll need to refresh the page after making edits.

&lt;h2&gt;10.1.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patch Changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/pull/309&quot;&gt;#309&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/commit/eb56a5e09964e49045bccde3c616275eb0a0902d&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;eb56a5e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JounQin&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​JounQin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! - fix: separate the &lt;code&gt;/flat&lt;/code&gt; entry for compatibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For flat config users, the previous &lt;code&gt;&quot;eslint-config-prettier&quot;&lt;/code&gt; entry still works, but &lt;code&gt;&quot;eslint-config-prettier/flat&quot;&lt;/code&gt; adds a new &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; property for &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-config-inspector/&quot;&gt;config-inspector&lt;/a&gt;, we just can't add it for the default entry for compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Type of Change

Edit/Clarification on existing content

### URL of existing page

https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/coffee-table-groups

### Context for content change

[This page](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/coffee-table-groups) is supposed to be a duplicate of [this page](https://vc-community-docs.netlify.app/docs/coffee-table-groups/coffee-table-groups-list), however, we have to manually update both pages each time a change is made to a Coffee Table Group.

Furthermore, many of these [guides to Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee) are already fully fleshed out in the VC Community Docs repo. It doesn't make sense to have two copies that are constantly out of sync when we've implemented Docusaurus.

### Proposed solution

## Simple Fix Solution

Since @adiati98 has put in all that amazing work of getting the VC Community Docs site online, I think we should start linking to it heavily from our vc.io site.

### Pros

- Much of the content in the vc.io website is already documented in the VC Community Docs site, so we'll instantly gain a value boost
- In regard to updates going forward, there will be an immediate reduction of labor while providing the equivalent or enhanced content outcomes
- Retains an organized structure and allows for increased discoverability

### Cons

- Navigating between vc.io and the VC Community Docs site isn't intuitive nor user-friendly as they are very much still separate entities
- There will be a lift at the very beginning to ensure no information is lost in the deduping process

## The More Involved One

We can create [MDX partials](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown) and dynamically import sections or even whole pages into each site from a central location. This would require vc.io and the VC Community Docs to co-exist within a [monorepo folder structure](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#monorepos).

### Pros

- The monorepo architecture is something we can take care of as Maintainers/Documentation Lead and need not concern our open-source contributors
- There will be **one definitive place** to update content that would otherwise be duplicated across both the vc.io website and the VC Community Docs site

### Cons

- The monorepo folder structure will take some configuring behind the scenes
- Save any fancy git-fu, there would be yet one more repo to keep track of

      <td>### Description of the bug
The documentation refers to a &quot;Connect with GitHub&quot; button to sign up or log in to OpenSauced, but this feature is no longer available. I confirmed with Brian from the team that the platform has been shut down, but the docs haven't been updated yet.


### Steps to reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Visit the documentation
2. Look for sign-up/login instructions
3. See the reference to a &quot;Connect with GitHub&quot; button


### Expected behavior
The documentation should reflect that sign-up and GitHub login are no longer available and maybe point users toward current community efforts if any.


### Additional context
I’m new to open source but would love to help fix this if someone could point me to the right place in the documentation.

Thanks!
