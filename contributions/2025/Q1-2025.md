These start on July 2024.<br><br><br><br>### Proposed solution<br><br>I&#39;m not sure the best way to handle this, so I&#39;d like some input from @danieltott. The newsletter section should take you to the subdomain, but it&#39;s useful to also give the users access to previous posts that weren&#39;t on beehiiv. Maybe there&#39;s also an &quot;archived newsletters&quot; section on the resources page? <br><br>### Resources that can help<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Collaborators<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [X] I&#39;ve read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community</td>
