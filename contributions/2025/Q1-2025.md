A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

There are a couple of things here:

1. After reading through the [Community Writers](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/main/community-writers/README.md) page, I believe the instructions in the `8. Scheduling and Publishing` section isn't completely true for scheduling and publishing a post on dev.to.

    Below is the lines of code:

    https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/19c7aeedab9dc64e3cf75993bb354592ff5a7375/community-writers/README.md?plain=1#L35-L44

    Here is one example:

    ```markdown
    - Add the metadescription to the description field
    ```

    There is no `metadescription` field on DEV.

2. The Markdown format in this page needs to be fixed as it gives lots of Markdown warnings.

### Proposed solution

- Update the content to ensure the accuracy of this page
- Fix the format to follow the best practice of Markdown 

### Resources that can help

_No response_

### Collaborators

@BekahHW can you confirm the instructions here? I can work on this if this is a go. Thanks!
