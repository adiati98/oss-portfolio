      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

There are a couple of things here:

1. After reading through the [Community Writers](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/main/community-writers/README.md) page, I believe the instructions in the `8. Scheduling and Publishing` section isn't completely true for scheduling and publishing a post on dev.to.

    Below is the lines of code:

    https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/19c7aeedab9dc64e3cf75993bb354592ff5a7375/community-writers/README.md?plain=1#L35-L44

    Here is one example:

    ```markdown
    - Add the metadescription to the description field
    ```

    There is no `metadescription` field on DEV.

2. The Markdown format in this page needs to be fixed as it gives lots of Markdown warnings.

### Proposed solution

- Update the content to ensure the accuracy of this page
- Fix the format to follow the best practice of Markdown 

### Resources that can help

_No response_

### Collaborators

@BekahHW can you confirm the instructions here? I can work on this if this is a go. Thanks!

<p>Adapters can now configure a default session storage driver when the <code>experimental.session</code> flag is enabled. If a hosting platform has a storage primitive that can be used for session storage, the adapter can automatically configure the session storage using that driver.

<p>Changes the <code>experimental.session</code> option to a boolean flag and moves session config to a top-level value. This change is to allow the new automatic session driver support. You now need to separately enable the <code>experimental.session</code> flag, and then configure the session driver using the top-level <code>session</code> key if providing manual configuration.</p>

export default {
  '*': 'prettier --write',

The <code>--experimental-strip-types</code> flag was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.6.0">Node.js v22.6.0</a> and unflagged in <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v23.6.0">v23.6.0</a>, enabling Node.js to execute TypeScript files without additional configuration.</p>

## Description

<!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

<h4>Treat U+30A0 &amp; U+30FB in Katakana Block as CJK (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/16796">#16796</a> by <a href="https://github.com/tats-u"><code>@​tats-u</code></a>)</h4>
<p>Prettier doesn't treat U+30A0 &amp; U+30FB as Japanese. U+30FB is commonly used in Japanese to represent the delimitation of first and last names of non-Japanese people or “and”. The following “C言語・C++・Go・Rust” means “C language &amp; C++ &amp; Go &amp; Rust” in Japanese.</p>

<pre lang="md"><code>&lt;!-- Input (--prose-wrap=never) --&gt;

<p>&lt;!-- Prettier 3.4.2 --&gt;<br />

</code></pre></p>
<p>U+30A0 can be used as the replacement of the <code>-</code> in non-Japanese names (e.g. “Saint-Saëns” (Charles Camille Saint-Saëns) can be represented as “サン゠サーンス” in Japanese), but substituted by ASCII hyphen (U+002D) or U+FF1D (full width hyphen) in many cases (e.g. “サン=サーンス” or “サン＝サーンス”).</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>19.0.0 (December 5, 2024)</h2>
<p>Below is a list of all new features, APIs, deprecations, and breaking changes. Read <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19">React 19 release post</a> and <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<h3>React</h3>
<ul>
<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>
<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>
<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>
<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>
<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>React DOM Client</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>
<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>
<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>
<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>
<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>
<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>React DOM Server</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>React Server Components</h3>
<ul>
<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href="https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>
<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href="https://github.com/testinglibrary"><code>@​testinglibrary</code></a>.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or <a href="https://github.com/testingesting-library"><code>@​testingesting-library</code></a>.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href="https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>
<h3>React</h3>
<ul>
<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.</li>
<li>Errors in render are not re-thrown: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are now reported to window.reportError. Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>
<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>
<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>
<li>Removed: <code>contextTypes</code> and <code>getChildContext</code>: Legacy Context for class components has been removed in favor of the <code>contextType</code> API.</li>

When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components.

</ul>
<h3>React Server Components</h3>
<ul>
<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href="https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href="https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>
<h3>React</h3>
<ul>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<h4>React</h4>
<ul>
<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>
<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>
<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>
<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>
<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>
</ul>
<h4>React DOM Client</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>
<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>
<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>
<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>
<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>
<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>React DOM Server</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>React Server Components</h4>
<ul>
<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href="https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deprecations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>
<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/"><code>@​testing-library/react</code></a> or <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro"><code>@​testing-library/react-native</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href="https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>
<h3>React</h3>
<ul>
<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.</li>
<li>Errors in render are not re-thrown: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are now reported to window.reportError. Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>
<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>
<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

The MC script needs a bit of a refresh. It hasn't had an overhaul in a few years so it's about time.

- We've shut down the Virtual Coffee merch store as it was a money pit 💸 
- The monthly newsletter link has changed
- All stages of the Coffee Chat event should be covered in the README
  - This will enable anyone to pick up the script and successfully MC a Coffee Chat without advanced prep (but hopefully that won't ever happen)
  - Add notes for what to expect during the breakout rooms
- Include items in the introduction instructions that we've added over time and stress that sharing is optional
  - These changes should be reflected in the Room Leader and Notetaker READMEs
- Give clearer instructions on what information is needed from a first time attendee
  - These changes should be reflected in the Room Leader and Notetaker READMEs
- Swap newsletter link in closing announcements for website events link, as the newsletter is often incorrect
- Add reference to `#questions-about-vc` Slack channel and LinkedIn page
- Remove additional references to newsletter and podcast since that's covered in the block of links

### Proposed solution

- [x] Remove all references and links pointing to the store
- [x] Change newsletter to correct link
- [x] Add LinkedIn reference
- [x] Add reference to `#questions-about-vc` Slack channel
- [x] Make section header names more detailed
- [x] Rewrite portions that are confusing or too wordy
- [x] Fix grammar and typos
- [x] Use [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) features
- [x] Lint markdown

### Type of Change

Edit/Clarification on existing content

### URL of existing page

_No response_

### Context for content change

Currently, we have: https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter, which requires someone to manually put the newsletter on the site. 

But with the recent updates, we now have: https://www.newsletter.virtualcoffee.io/, which is automatically generated when we send out our newsletter. 

I don't want to lose the newsletters that we have on the site that are not on the beehiiv site. These start on July 2024.



### Proposed solution

I'm not sure the best way to handle this, so I'd like some input from @danieltott. The newsletter section should take you to the subdomain, but it's useful to also give the users access to previous posts that weren't on beehiiv. Maybe there's also an "archived newsletters" section on the resources page?
