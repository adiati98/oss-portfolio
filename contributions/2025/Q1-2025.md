## Description

This PR fixes a typo and changes the word &quot;quarterly&quot; to &quot;quarter&quot;.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## ⚠️  Special Notes

- This PR doesn't change any content of existing docs
- The README in the `docs` folder is a duplication from existing README with adjusted links
- The keywords in the front matter are generated and haven't been adjusted
- The old docs are included in the comment in the `sidebar.js` in case we need it. 

We will create separate issues for any changes regarding the above matters to make sure this PR is not going out of the issue's scope.

## Description

This PR updates the documentation of &quot;New Year, New Goal&quot; challenge.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

There are a couple of things here:

1. After reading through the [Community Writers](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/main/community-writers/README.md) page, I believe the instructions in the `8. Scheduling and Publishing` section isn't completely true for scheduling and publishing a post on dev.to.

    Below is the lines of code:

    https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/19c7aeedab9dc64e3cf75993bb354592ff5a7375/community-writers/README.md?plain=1#L35-L44

    Here is one example:

    ```markdown
    - Add the metadescription to the description field
    ```

    There is no `metadescription` field on DEV.

2. The Markdown format in this page needs to be fixed as it gives lots of Markdown warnings.

### Proposed solution

- Update the content to ensure the accuracy of this page
- Fix the format to follow the best practice of Markdown 

### Resources that can help

@BekahHW can you confirm the instructions here? I can work on this if this is a go. Thanks!

There are a couple of things here:

1. After reading through the [Community Writers](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/main/community-writers/README.md) page, I believe the instructions in the `8. Scheduling and Publishing` section isn't completely true for scheduling and publishing a post on dev.to.

    Below is the lines of code:

    https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/19c7aeedab9dc64e3cf75993bb354592ff5a7375/community-writers/README.md?plain=1#L35-L44

    Here is one example:

    ```markdown
    - Add the metadescription to the description field
    ```

    There is no `metadescription` field on DEV.

2. The Markdown format in this page needs to be fixed as it gives lots of Markdown warnings.

### Context for documentation change

There are a couple of things here:

1. After reading through the [Community Writers](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/main/community-writers/README.md) page, I believe the instructions in the `8. Scheduling and Publishing` section isn't completely true for scheduling and publishing a post on dev.to.

    Below is the lines of code:

    https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/19c7aeedab9dc64e3cf75993bb354592ff5a7375/community-writers/README.md?plain=1#L35-L44

    Here is one example:

    ```markdown
    - Add the metadescription to the description field
    ```

    There is no `metadescription` field on DEV.

2. The Markdown format in this page needs to be fixed as it gives lots of Markdown warnings.

### Proposed solution

- Update the content to ensure the accuracy of this page
- Fix the format to follow the best practice of Markdown

@BekahHW can you confirm the instructions here? I can work on this if this is a go. Thanks!

Typo

### Context for content change

We branded our newly challenge with &quot;Quarter Challenge&quot; and not &quot;Quarterly Challenge&quot;.
Therefore, we need to change the word &quot;Quarterly&quot; to &quot;Quarter&quot;.
