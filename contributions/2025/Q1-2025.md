## Description

This PR fixes a typo and changes the word &quot;quarterly&quot; to &quot;quarter&quot;.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Description

This PR consists below changes in the monthly challenge documentation:

- Fixed Markdown warnings
- Fixed the structure of the documentation to get it ready for moving to Docusaurus
- Added December 2024 challenge

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## ⚠️  Special Notes

- This PR doesn't change any content of existing docs
- The README in the `docs` folder is a duplication from existing README with adjusted links
- The keywords in the front matter are generated and haven't been adjusted
- The old docs are included in the comment in the `sidebar.js` in case we need it. 

We will create separate issues for any changes regarding the above matters to make sure this PR is not going out of the issue's scope.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

There are a couple of things here:

1. After reading through the [Community Writers](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/main/community-writers/README.md) page, I believe the instructions in the `8. Scheduling and Publishing` section isn't completely true for scheduling and publishing a post on dev.to.

    Below is the lines of code:

    https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/19c7aeedab9dc64e3cf75993bb354592ff5a7375/community-writers/README.md?plain=1#L35-L44

    Here is one example:

    ```markdown
    - Add the metadescription to the description field
    ```

    There is no `metadescription` field on DEV.

2. The Markdown format in this page needs to be fixed as it gives lots of Markdown warnings.

### Proposed solution

- Update the content to ensure the accuracy of this page
- Fix the format to follow the best practice of Markdown 

### Resources that can help

_No response_

### Collaborators

@BekahHW can you confirm the instructions here? I can work on this if this is a go. Thanks!

### Context for documentation change

There are a couple of things here:

1. After reading through the [Community Writers](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/main/community-writers/README.md) page, I believe the instructions in the `8. Scheduling and Publishing` section isn't completely true for scheduling and publishing a post on dev.to.

    Below is the lines of code:

    https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/blob/19c7aeedab9dc64e3cf75993bb354592ff5a7375/community-writers/README.md?plain=1#L35-L44

    Here is one example:

    ```markdown
    - Add the metadescription to the description field
    ```

    There is no `metadescription` field on DEV.

2. The Markdown format in this page needs to be fixed as it gives lots of Markdown warnings.

### Proposed solution

- Update the content to ensure the accuracy of this page
- Fix the format to follow the best practice of Markdown

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it's been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.

Edit/Clarification on existing content

### URL of existing page

_No response_

### Context for content change

Currently, we have: https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter, which requires someone to manually put the newsletter on the site. 

But with the recent updates, we now have: https://www.newsletter.virtualcoffee.io/, which is automatically generated when we send out our newsletter. 

I don't want to lose the newsletters that we have on the site that are not on the beehiiv site. These start on July 2024.



### Proposed solution

I'm not sure the best way to handle this, so I'd like some input from @danieltott. The newsletter section should take you to the subdomain, but it's useful to also give the users access to previous posts that weren't on beehiiv. Maybe there's also an &quot;archived newsletters&quot; section on the resources page?

As our docs for monthly challenges is getting longer, it needs to have more structure and follow the best practice of Markdown. Also, they start to throw Markdown warnings on VSCode.

## Suggested Solution

- Fix the Markdown as much as possible to follow the best practice.
- Fix the structure of the whole monthly challenge docs to get it ready for Docusaurus.</td>

      <td>## Description

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it's been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.

## Suggested Solution

Install and add content to Docusaurus.</td>

### Context for content change

Currently, we have: https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter, which requires someone to manually put the newsletter on the site. 

But with the recent updates, we now have: https://www.newsletter.virtualcoffee.io/, which is automatically generated when we send out our newsletter. 

I don't want to lose the newsletters that we have on the site that are not on the beehiiv site. These start on July 2024.



### Proposed solution

I'm not sure the best way to handle this, so I'd like some input from @danieltott. The newsletter section should take you to the subdomain, but it's useful to also give the users access to previous posts that weren't on beehiiv. Maybe there's also an &quot;archived newsletters&quot; section on the resources page?

We branded our newly challenge with &quot;Quarter Challenge&quot; and not &quot;Quarterly Challenge&quot;.
