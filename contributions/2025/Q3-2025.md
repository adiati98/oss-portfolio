That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword "Closes" followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

-->

<!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

-->

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR converts the "Tester" section into RST.

## Linked Issue

Closes #358 

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

### Existing page - with embed

## Important Note

I removed the Developer Documentation section (https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/developer/developer-documentation) from this page, because we have a new section that much more comprehensive (https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing_docs_rst.rst).

Instead, I added an admonition to suggest folks who create changes on a PR to update the docs at the end of "Pull requests" section.

## The Issue

- #<issue number>

<!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. -->

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. 

This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.

## Manual Testing Instructions

  In line 21, link the "Marketing Team" to the Marketing Team section within the community handbook.

- **Grammar**

  Fix the grammar in the "Marketer" section by addressing the vale warnings and suggestions. Feel free to improve the copy when you see fit.

## How to fix

### Link

1. Open the file at: `docs/contributing/marketer.rst`.
2. Replace [Marketing Team] in line 32 with:

  ````
  :doc: `teams/marketing_team/marketing_team`
  ````
4. In your terminal, **make sure that you're on the `docs` directory**.
5. Run `make html` command. Make sure that there is no build error and you see "build succeeded."
6. Remove the comment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always test your changes by viewing the page on the live preview and click each link. Make sure that they redirect to the correct target page.

### Grammar
  
1. Open the file at: `docs/contributing/marketer.rst`
2. Remove the `.. vale off` and `.. vale on` lines in the file.
3. In the terminal, navigate to the `contributing` folder. Assuming you're on the `docs` directory, run `cd contributing` command.
4. Run `vale .`
5. Find the file name, then address each vale warning and suggestion listed under the file name as much as possible. You can check if they're fixed by running the `vale .` command again.

This pull request adds a new resource page, "Navigating the Job Hunt with AI," to the developer resources section. The page provides a comprehensive guide on how to leverage AI tools for various aspects of the job search process, including resume building, portfolio creation, and interview preparation. It includes actionable steps, example prompts, and practical tips for job seekers.

### New Resource Page: "Navigating the Job Hunt with AI"

* **Page Metadata and Structure**:
  - Added metadata (`title`, `description`, `hero`, and `order`) for the new page.
  - Imported reusable components such as `LeadText`, `TextContainer`, and `Link` for consistent styling and layout.

* **Content Highlights**:
  - Introduced a step-by-step guide covering six key areas: defining job search context, building a portfolio, creating a social media plan, optimizing resumes, writing cover letters, and preparing for interviews. Each section includes actionable steps, example prompts, and example outputs.
  - Added a "Pro Tips for Success" section with best practices for using AI effectively, such as providing context, iterating on drafts, and adding authenticity.
  - Included a "Quick Reference: High-Impact Prompts" section summarizing key AI prompts for resumes,

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.
