That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword "Closes" followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

-->

<!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

-->

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR converts the "Tester" section into RST.

## Linked Issue

Closes #358 

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

### Existing page - with embed

## Important Note

I removed the Developer Documentation section (https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/developer/developer-documentation) from this page, because we have a new section that much more comprehensive (https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing_docs_rst.rst).

Instead, I added an admonition to suggest folks who create changes on a PR to update the docs at the end of "Pull requests" section.

## The Issue

- #<issue number>

<!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. -->

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. 

This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.

Replace the [The easy way: using Gitpod](https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/tester#the-easy-way-using-gitpod) section with GitHub Codespaces.</td>

## How to fix

### Link

1. Open the file at: `docs/contributing/marketer.rst`.
2. Replace [Marketing Team] in line 32 with:

  ````
  :doc: `teams/marketing_team/marketing_team`
  ````
4. In your terminal, **make sure that you're on the `docs` directory**.
5. Run `make html` command. Make sure that there is no build error and you see "build succeeded."
6. Remove the comment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always test your changes by viewing the page on the live preview and click each link. Make sure that they redirect to the correct target page.

### Grammar
  
1. Open the file at: `docs/contributing/marketer.rst`
2. Remove the `.. vale off` and `.. vale on` lines in the file.
3. In the terminal, navigate to the `contributing` folder. Assuming you're on the `docs` directory, run `cd contributing` command.
4. Run `vale .`
5. Find the file name, then address each vale warning and suggestion listed under the file name as much as possible. You can check if they're fixed by running the `vale .` command again.

> [!NOTE]
> Please read and follow our [Style Guide](https://contribute.mautic.org/education-team/technical-writing-styleguide) when fixing/updating writing style and grammar in our docs.</td>

## Description

<!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

-->

Updated VC Slack Channels Guide to reflect the current Slack channel names.
@adiati98  Let me know what you think of the changes, is it good to go?

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

-->

Updated Slack channel references in the website guides to reflect recent changes. Some channels were renamed, some archived, and new ones were added. This ensures clarity and consistency across documentation.

Blog/Screencast DDEV on WSL2 from scratch.

Rendered at https://20250723-wsl-from-scratch.ddev-com-front-end.pages.dev/blog/watch-ddev-local-from-scratch-with-windows-wsl2/

Screencast has captions, yay! (Captions are easy to edit and they're included in srt file here)

Comments on the screencast itself are welcome, but I probably won't edit it if they're not really important. If there are significant problems we may be able to warn about them in the blog post, and I might be able to do overlays in the video.

Claude Code was able to create the captions by grabbing the audio, then put it in an editable format, then apply the edits. It was also able to do the table of contents. In each case it needed quite a bit of coaching, but it was pretty amazing to use it.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

I've noticed inconsistent terminology throughout our documentation. This is certainly to be expected in projects with multiple contributors!

For example, one of our volunteer positions is referred to as: `notetaker`, `note taker`, and `note-taker` at varying points in this repository – and that's without taking capitalization into account. Another example is our how we refer to our Tuesday/Thursday Coffee meetings. It varies between `coffees`, `coffee chats`, `Tuesday/Thursday Coffees`, among other miscellaneous terms.

We should develop a style guide to pair with the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file as well as a glossary of terminology. I know there's currently a glossary on the website, but it may be more prudent to move it to this repo for ease of editing and discoverability.

### Proposed solution

This will be a bit of a larger lift overall, so I propose breaking it up into sub-issues.

1. Go through the repo and make a list of terminology we'll need to standardize and include in the glossary. We can start the list from the linked discussion below.
2. Replace each term with the standardized version. If we again stall on coming to a consensus, we should at least pick something and homogenize them so they'll be easier to replace later once a decision is made.
3. Move the glossary from the website to this repo.

### Resources that can help

I started a discussion to [Revisit Our Naming Conventions for Volunteer Roles](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/discussions/352), however, it grew stale quite quickly and hasn't resulted in any actionable decisions despite my attempts to revive it.

This is the [glossary](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/glossary) I referenced that's currently hosted on the website.

### Collaborators

I'll definitely need input from @adiati98 as Documentation Lead. I think @BekahHW will also want to weigh in on how we decide to standardize our documentation terminology. I'm going to tag @dominicduffin1, @tkshill, and @danieltott in case they have opinions to share.

You can do this in the current repo, as we've got a folder set up, `/docs`, which will be used for Read The Docs.

You can build this documentation locally by cloning this repository, and following these steps: https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/tree/5.x?tab=readme-ov-file#build-documentation-locally. Change into the /docs folder and then (assuming you have DDEV and Docker/Colima installed) type `ddev config` and select `build/html `as the root folder when configuring DDEV. Then when complete, type `ddev start` and it'll give you the link to your local testing environment.

If you need to make a link file to add an external URL, please use the command line tool 'make link'. This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.

For internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).

**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**

When you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**. We can create a structure using sub-folders to organise the sections. You also need to add the pages to the Table of Contents in the index.rst file for them to show on the menu. Docs on the ToC can be found [here](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indices.html).

We highly recommend that you use VS Code with Vale installed. Let us know if you have any problems.

Some useful resources: 
- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest guide to Sphinx/RST formatting
- https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#use-the-external-links-extension how to do external links - always check the /docs/links directory first! You can use the terminal command '`make link`' to create the link file automagically.

There are many MD to RST tools out there which can help speed up the process, however you will still need to review your output to ensure it passes our Vale grammar rules. Headings must always be unique, as well.

We use the following for headings:

```
H1 ###
H2 ***
H3 ===
H4 ---
H5 ~~~
```
