&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Linked Issue

Closes #358 

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

### Existing page - with embed

## Important Note

I removed the Developer Documentation section (https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/developer/developer-documentation) from this page, because we have a new section that much more comprehensive (https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing_docs_rst.rst).

Instead, I added an admonition to suggest folks who create changes on a PR to update the docs at the end of &quot;Pull requests&quot; section.

## The Issue

- #&lt;issue number&gt;

&lt;!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. --&gt;

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. 

This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.

## Manual Testing Instructions

https://ddev--7476.org.readthedocs.build/en/7476/users/install/ddev-installation/#ddev-installation-windows

## Automated Testing Overview

&lt;!-- Please describe the tests introduced by this PR, or explain why no tests are needed. --&gt;

## Release/Deployment Notes

&lt;!-- Does this affect anything else or have ramifications for other code? Does anything have to be done on deployment? --&gt;

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

### Existing page - with embed

## Important Note

I removed the Developer Documentation section (https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/developer/developer-documentation) from this page, because we have a new section that much more comprehensive (https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing_docs_rst.rst).

Instead, I added an admonition to suggest folks who create changes on a PR to update the docs at the end of &quot;Pull requests&quot; section.

## The Issue

- #&lt;issue number&gt;

&lt;!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. --&gt;

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. 

This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.

## Manual Testing Instructions

https://ddev--7476.org.readthedocs.build/en/7476/users/install/ddev-installation/#ddev-installation-windows

## Automated Testing Overview

&lt;!-- Please describe the tests introduced by this PR, or explain why no tests are needed. --&gt;

## Release/Deployment Notes

&lt;!-- Does this affect anything else or have ramifications for other code? Does anything have to be done on deployment? --&gt;

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

## Important Note

I removed the Developer Documentation section (https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/developer/developer-documentation) from this page, because we have a new section that much more comprehensive (https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing_docs_rst.rst).

Instead, I added an admonition to suggest folks who create changes on a PR to update the docs at the end of &quot;Pull requests&quot; section.

## The Issue

- #&lt;issue number&gt;

&lt;!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. --&gt;

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. 

This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

## The Issue

- #&lt;issue number&gt;

&lt;!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. --&gt;

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

## Important Note

I removed the Developer Documentation section (https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/developer/developer-documentation) from this page, because we have a new section that much more comprehensive (https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing_docs_rst.rst).

Instead, I added an admonition to suggest folks who create changes on a PR to update the docs at the end of &quot;Pull requests&quot; section.

## The Issue

- #&lt;issue number&gt;

&lt;!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. --&gt;

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. 

This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.

## Manual Testing Instructions

## Automated Testing Overview

## Release/Deployment Notes

&lt;!-- Does this affect anything else or have ramifications for other code? Does anything have to be done on deployment? --&gt;

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

## Important Note

I removed the Developer Documentation section (https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/developer/developer-documentation) from this page, because we have a new section that much more comprehensive (https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing_docs_rst.rst).

Instead, I added an admonition to suggest folks who create changes on a PR to update the docs at the end of &quot;Pull requests&quot; section.

## The Issue

- #&lt;issue number&gt;

&lt;!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. --&gt;

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. 

This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.

## Manual Testing Instructions

https://ddev--7476.org.readthedocs.build/en/7476/users/install/ddev-installation/#ddev-installation-windows

## Automated Testing Overview

&lt;!-- Please describe the tests introduced by this PR, or explain why no tests are needed. --&gt;

## Release/Deployment Notes

&lt;!-- Does this affect anything else or have ramifications for other code? Does anything have to be done on deployment? --&gt;

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Notes

In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don't recommend this.

Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.

## Important Note

I removed the Developer Documentation section (https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/developer/developer-documentation) from this page, because we have a new section that much more comprehensive (https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing_docs_rst.rst).

Instead, I added an admonition to suggest folks who create changes on a PR to update the docs at the end of &quot;Pull requests&quot; section.

## The Issue

- #&lt;issue number&gt;

&lt;!-- Provide a brief description of the issue. --&gt;

## How This PR Solves The Issue

When installing DDEV, I got an error message saying that DDEV can't be installed. After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.

Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. 

This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.

## Manual Testing Instructions

https://ddev--7476.org.readthedocs.build/en/7476/users/install/ddev-installation/#ddev-installation-windows

## Automated Testing Overview

&lt;!-- Please describe the tests introduced by this PR, or explain why no tests are needed. --&gt;

## Release/Deployment Notes

&lt;!-- Does this affect anything else or have ramifications for other code? Does anything have to be done on deployment? --&gt;
