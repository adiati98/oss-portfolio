      <td>## Linked Issue<br><br>Closes #1373 <br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>If you have a pull request related to a current issue please link to that issue number.<br><br>That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.<br><br>To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword &quot;Closes&quot; followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Description<br><br>This PR holds the below changes:<br><br>- Add `aug-2025/page.tsx` for the &quot;August 2025: Photography Challenge&quot;<br>- Update the challenge homepage for the current challenge<br>- Add completed challenge banner to the `page.tsx` in summer-2025.<br><br>### Live Preview<br><br>https://deploy-preview-1374--virtual-coffee-io.netlify.app/monthlychallenges<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.<br><br>It explains what you&#39;ve done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.<br><br>A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.<br><br>If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.<br><br>@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Methodology<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>This section explains why the above changes were made.<br><br>Sometimes a developer feels that it&#39;s okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That&#39;s fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.<br><br>If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it&#39;s always good to attach a document reference link for that information.<br><br>A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Code of Conduct<br><br>&gt; By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)<br></td>

      <td>## Description<br><br>This PR converts the &quot;Tester&quot; section into RST.<br><br>## Linked Issue<br><br>Closes #358 <br><br>## Notes<br><br>In the existing section, we have a YouTube embed. After some research, the only way to embed a YouTube video is with [sphinxcontrib-youtube extension](https://sphinxcontrib-youtube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, [the repository](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file) seems no longer maintained (last updated was 2 years ago). So, I don&#39;t recommend this.<br><br>Therefore, I changed the embed into a tip admonition instead as screenshot below.<br><br>### Existing page - with embed<br><br>&lt;img width=&quot;1233&quot; height=&quot;708&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-07-31 001528&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a7bac45-d3c0-4421-828e-cc8d57d116b5&quot; /&gt;<br><br>### New version - tip admonition<br><br>&lt;img width=&quot;1013&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-07-30 234153&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c8dba15-930d-407b-9ada-f4a90b046888&quot; /&gt;<br></td>

After [a discussion and troubleshooting on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/664580571770388500/1397288639503007825), re-installing the WSL with `wsl --install` and updating with `wsl --update` solved the problem. DDEV was installed smoothly.<br><br>Based on this, in some cases, running `wsl --update` command after installing WSL on Windows might be required to install DDEV successfully. <br><br>This PR adds the command to appropriate parts of the docs.<br><br>## Manual Testing Instructions<br><br>https://ddev--7476.org.readthedocs.build/en/7476/users/install/ddev-installation/#ddev-installation-windows<br><br>## Automated Testing Overview<br><br>&lt;!-- Please describe the tests introduced by this PR, or explain why no tests are needed. --&gt;<br><br>## Release/Deployment Notes<br><br>&lt;!-- Does this affect anything else or have ramifications for other code? Does anything have to be done on deployment? --&gt;<br></td>

      <td>## Linked Issue<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>If you have a pull request related to a current issue please link to that issue number.<br><br>That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.<br><br>To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword &quot;Closes&quot; followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.<br><br>--&gt;<br>Closes #1363  <br><br>## Description<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.<br><br>It explains what you&#39;ve done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.<br><br>A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.<br><br>If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.<br><br>@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>Updated VC Slack Channels Guide to reflect the current Slack channel names.<br>@adiati98  Let me know what you think of the changes, is it good to go?<br><br>## Methodology<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>This section explains why the above changes were made.<br><br>Sometimes a developer feels that it&#39;s okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That&#39;s fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.<br><br>If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it&#39;s always good to attach a document reference link for that information.<br><br>A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>Updated Slack channel references in the website guides to reflect recent changes. Some channels were renamed, some archived, and new ones were added. This ensures clarity and consistency across documentation.<br><br>## Code of Conduct<br><br>&gt; By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)<br></td>

      <td>## The Issue<br><br>Blog/Screencast DDEV on WSL2 from scratch.<br><br>Rendered at https://20250723-wsl-from-scratch.ddev-com-front-end.pages.dev/blog/watch-ddev-local-from-scratch-with-windows-wsl2/<br><br>Screencast has captions, yay! (Captions are easy to edit and they&#39;re included in srt file here)<br><br>Comments on the screencast itself are welcome, but I probably won&#39;t edit it if they&#39;re not really important. If there are significant problems we may be able to warn about them in the blog post, and I might be able to do overlays in the video.<br><br>Claude Code was able to create the captions by grabbing the audio, then put it in an editable format, then apply the edits. It was also able to do the table of contents. In each case it needed quite a bit of coaching, but it was pretty amazing to use it.<br></td>

You get the gist.<br><br>A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.<br><br>If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.<br><br>@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>- <br>This pull request adds a new resource page, &quot;Navigating the Job Hunt with AI,&quot; to the developer resources section. The page provides a comprehensive guide on how to leverage AI tools for various aspects of the job search process, including resume building, portfolio creation, and interview preparation. It includes actionable steps, example prompts, and practical tips for job seekers.<br><br>### New Resource Page: &quot;Navigating the Job Hunt with AI&quot;<br><br>* **Page Metadata and Structure**:<br>  - Added metadata (`title`, `description`, `hero`, and `order`) for the new page.<br>  - Imported reusable components such as `LeadText`, `TextContainer`, and `Link` for consistent styling and layout.<br><br>* **Content Highlights**:<br>  - Introduced a step-by-step guide covering six key areas: defining job search context, building a portfolio, creating a social media plan, optimizing resumes, writing cover letters, and preparing for interviews. Each section includes actionable steps, example prompts, and example outputs.<br>  - Added a &quot;Pro Tips for Success&quot; section with best practices for using AI effectively, such as providing context, iterating on drafts, and adding authenticity.<br>  - Included a &quot;Quick Reference: High-Impact Prompts&quot; section summarizing key AI prompts for resumes,<br><br>## Methodology<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>This section explains why the above changes were made.<br><br>Sometimes a developer feels that it&#39;s okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That&#39;s fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.<br><br>If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it&#39;s always good to attach a document reference link for that information.<br><br>A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Code of Conduct<br><br>&gt; By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)<br></td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?<br><br>- [x] I have searched the existing issues<br><br>### Context for documentation change<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed inconsistent terminology throughout our documentation. This is certainly to be expected in projects with multiple contributors!<br><br>For example, one of our volunteer positions is referred to as: `notetaker`, `note taker`, and `note-taker` at varying points in this repository – and that&#39;s without taking capitalization into account. Another example is our how we refer to our Tuesday/Thursday Coffee meetings. It varies between `coffees`, `coffee chats`, `Tuesday/Thursday Coffees`, among other miscellaneous terms.<br><br>We should develop a style guide to pair with the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file as well as a glossary of terminology. I know there&#39;s currently a glossary on the website, but it may be more prudent to move it to this repo for ease of editing and discoverability.<br><br>### Proposed solution<br><br>This will be a bit of a larger lift overall, so I propose breaking it up into sub-issues.<br><br>1. Go through the repo and make a list of terminology we&#39;ll need to standardize and include in the glossary. We can start the list from the linked discussion below.<br>2. Replace each term with the standardized version. If we again stall on coming to a consensus, we should at least pick something and homogenize them so they&#39;ll be easier to replace later once a decision is made.<br>3. Move the glossary from the website to this repo.<br><br>### Resources that can help<br><br>I started a discussion to [Revisit Our Naming Conventions for Volunteer Roles](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/discussions/352), however, it grew stale quite quickly and hasn&#39;t resulted in any actionable decisions despite my attempts to revive it.<br><br>This is the [glossary](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/glossary) I referenced that&#39;s currently hosted on the website.<br><br>### Collaborators<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely need input from @adiati98 as Documentation Lead. I think @BekahHW will also want to weigh in on how we decide to standardize our documentation terminology. I&#39;m going to tag @dominicduffin1, @tkshill, and @danieltott in case they have opinions to share.<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [x] I&#39;ve read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community</td>
