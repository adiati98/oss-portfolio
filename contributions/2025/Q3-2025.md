## Suggested Solution

Replace the [The easy way: using Gitpod](https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic/tester#the-easy-way-using-gitpod) section with GitHub Codespaces.</td>

This pull request adds a new resource page, "Navigating the Job Hunt with AI," to the developer resources section. The page provides a comprehensive guide on how to leverage AI tools for various aspects of the job search process, including resume building, portfolio creation, and interview preparation. It includes actionable steps, example prompts, and practical tips for job seekers.

### New Resource Page: "Navigating the Job Hunt with AI"

* **Page Metadata and Structure**:
  - Added metadata (`title`, `description`, `hero`, and `order`) for the new page.
  - Imported reusable components such as `LeadText`, `TextContainer`, and `Link` for consistent styling and layout.

* **Content Highlights**:
  - Introduced a step-by-step guide covering six key areas: defining job search context, building a portfolio, creating a social media plan, optimizing resumes, writing cover letters, and preparing for interviews. Each section includes actionable steps, example prompts, and example outputs.
  - Added a "Pro Tips for Success" section with best practices for using AI effectively, such as providing context, iterating on drafts, and adding authenticity.
  - Included a "Quick Reference: High-Impact Prompts" section summarizing key AI prompts for resumes,

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.
