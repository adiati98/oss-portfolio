<!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

-->

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

<!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

-->

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR mainly fixes the relative paths that lead to 404 in GitHub. They're still working as intended on the website.

Along the fixes, this PR also holds the following changes:

- Added relative paths to the "next chapter" term in the last paragraph of each chapter for better navigation on GitHub. In the case of no last paragraph, I added a sentence for navigation.
- Added relative paths to the chapter titles on README (for consistency with the future Maintainers course) and `intro.md`.
- Restructured the sidebar by moving the "Conclusion" chapter to before "Additional Resouces" for better flow.

### Note

@BekahHW I've tested the relative paths on a private repo and they work well.

      <td>## Description

As this repository is completely to add contributors to the guestbook with minimum information and we're moving translations at the Open Sauced Education Path to be Community Translations, we don't need to translate anything here. Therefore, the translation guidelines is not necessary.

## Suggested Solution

- Remove the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Remove the "Translations" list from the [Contributing](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributing) section on the README.</td>

      <td>## Description

As part of Intro to OSS course, the contributing guidelines in this guestbook repo is following and being adjusted from the guidelines at the intro repository. But as the intro repository evolves, the contributing guidelines in this repo is no longer 100% accurate. Therefore, it needs to be updated.

Another reason is as Hacktoberfest is approaching, we want to make this repo ready for contributions not only from the course participants, but also from folks who don't take our Intro to OSS course.

## Suggested Solution

### Alternative 1

Update the contributing guidelines by adding instructions from [Let's Get Practical](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section and adjust other sections accordingly.

### Alternative 2

Remove the contributing guidelines completely with below reasons:

- We have the [Getting Started](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section on the README that navigate folks to the instructions of adding themselves to the guestbook.
- The [Contributing](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributing) section on the README already holds the information for folks to improve our Intro to OSS course. </td>

      <td>### Suggested solution

## Description

As per discussion, moving forward, we will have all translations as "Community Translations". 

Having our community to translate and host the translations on their forked repo will give them below benefits:

- They will have the opportunity to learn to maintain a project, nurture a community, and become the maintainer of the translation as it will live in their forked repo,
- They can make the the translation available soonest,
- They can update the translation faster as they are able to review and merge in PRs themselves as a maintainer.

## Suggested Solution

We need to update the translation guidelines to hold the content of community translations, for example, how to structure their forked repo, update the translations with the current state of the English version, and self-host the website.

We also need to update pages that include these guidelines such as README, etc.

There's an orange rectangle  in the All Contributions tree map in the Activity dashboard of Contributor Insights Page. I highlighted it and learned that it's a "Back" button.

There is no text available on the rectangle unless it's highlighted (on the desktop). Also, nothing happened when I click it.

Based on the conversation on Slack with @BekahHW, it's now quite challenging for folks who wants to join VC to find information about how to join VC and what can they expect from joining VC.

### Proposed solution

Add a link to `/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/join-virtual-coffee` to the Nav Bar with the text "Join". I like @eternalmaha 's idea of putting it before Store.

No need to change the page location at all - just a straight link will do 👍

      <td>### Suggested solution

## Background

As I'm trying to find a way to create a base for our community translations, it gave me a thought.

So far, I don't see any open source project that has contributing & translation guidelines chapters on their live website. Usually, they have either:

   - "Edit this page on GH" that bring folks to the page file on GH, or
   - Link to the repo on GH.

   But we do have [contributing guidelines](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/CONTRIBUTING) and [translations guidelines](http://localhost:3000/#/i18n-guidelines) live on our website. I think it makes more sense if these files live _only_ in the repo.

For that reason, I propose to move `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `i18n-guidelines.md` to the root. We will still link these on the homepage of the course.

### Alternative

If we want to be a bit more organized, we can follow GH docs repo. They have a [contributing folder](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/contributing) that contains various contributing guidelines. So we can create a `contributing` folder at the root and move the guidelines files into this folder.

## Community Translations

In the forked repo of translations, they will have these in their root:

- Translated `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Translated `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- A contributing file that contains guidelines to contribute to the forked repo.

   They can name it anything, but preferably consistent across forked repos for documentation matter. So, maybe something like: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-LANG.md` and change the `LANG` to the translated languange. For example: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-ES.md`. They can link this file in the README on the root. This file can be upper- or lower-case. It doesn't matter as there is no convention for this. However, we want this to be consistent across forked repos.

      <td>### Suggested solution

### README

The README that's available at the moment is coming from the `docs`, which is the homepage of "The Open Source Education with OpenSauced".

Adding a README dedicated for the repo will have these benefits:

- Make it consistence with other OpenSauced repos where there is a logo and contains information about the repository itself.
- Considering that we will have community translations that live in forked repos, these translations has a place to link their contributing guidelines (to contribute to the forked repo) on the README.

### LICENSE

Although we have a section for license in the README, there is no license can be found In the "About" section on the sidebar of the repo as per screenshot below.

![About section of OpenSauced intro repo](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/assets/45172775/61ad1856-89a0-4ac1-8f70-f6bc2387824b)

This is because the file is located in the `docs` folder. We need to move this file to the root of the project.

## Description

This repo is meant for our intro course participants to continue their learning by adding pizza-related information. Even though pizza is a favorite to most people, adding pizza-related information would be hard for folks who don't have interest in pizzas. We might want to add something else to this repo to spark interest for our course participants in continuing their learning.

## Suggested Solution

Let's allow folks to add their favorite foods from their own countries! In international space, folks usually love to talk about their country, culture, and even their traditional foods. By allowing them to add this, we might be able to encourage folks to contribute further. 

We will need:

- [x] A new file called `world-traditional-foods.md`.
- [x] An example in the file.
- [x] A new open issue.
- [x] Information about this addition in the README. 
- [x] Update the PR template to include this addition.</td>

We have a "Job Seekers Guide" in our docs that is suitable to be added into the "Intro to Open Source" course.

### Suggested solution

In line 75 in the [`docs/intro-to-oss/the-secret-sauce.md`](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/the-secret-sauce.md), add a sentence at the end with copy as follow:

```markdown
Additionally, you can refer to the [Job Seekers Guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/opensauced-guides/job-seekers-guide/job-seekers-guide-introduction/) on our docs to learn how to use OpenSauced to land a job in the tech industry.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've worked on a "good first issue" or "beginners only" issue in any of our [community repositories](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/opensauced-maintainers-guide/community-maintainers-guide/#opensauced-community-repositories) before, please refrain from taking this issue.
> We may remove you from the assignees and not accept your pull request if you choose to proceed.

Here are the background:

- There is no main title in the "Additional Resources" page.
- Because the "Conclusion" section is the last chapter of our course, we can adjust the wording in the intro paragraph of this page.
- There is a subtitle that needs to be capitalized.

### Suggested Solution

- [ ] Add a main title on the first line.

   ```markdown
   # Additional Resources
   ```

- [ ] Change the wording in the first paragraph with:

   ```markdown
   On this page, you can find resources to help you learn further about contributing to open source:
   ```

   Code to be changed:

- [ ] Fix capitalization of "Blog Posts" subsection.

   ```markdown
   ## Blog Posts
   ```

   Code to be changed:

      <td>### Describe the bug

When I wanted to delete a couple of Contributor Insight Pages in a row, I couldn't do it without refreshing the page.

Here is what I did:

- After deleting a page, I wanted to delete another page.
- I typed the page name that I want to delete, but clicking the "Delete" button didn't do anything.
- Clicking the "x" icon to clear the name also didn't work.
- Only the "Cancel" button worked.
- I tried one more time with the same result.
- This finally worked after I refreshed the page.


### Steps to reproduce

1. In the sidebar, click the "Show all" option for Contributor Insights.
2. Click "bin" icon and delete a page.
3. Click "bin" icon to delete another page.
4. Type the page name and click the "Delete" button. You will see that nothing happen.
5. Click the "x" icon next to the name to clear the input. Nothing happens.
6. Click the "Cancel" button. It will take you back to the list.
7. Repeat step 3 - 6. Nothing will happen.
8. Refresh the page and repeat step 3 - 4.
9. Now it deletes the page as it should.

      <td>## Description

GitHub is moving away from Projects (classic) to Projects.

As mentioned on [the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards):

> You can only create a new project (classic) for an organization or user that already has at least one project (classic). You cannot create new projects (classic) for repositories. If you're unable to create a project (classic), create a project instead.

In my own recent experience, I can't create a project (classic) anymore, although I have several projects (classic).

## Suggestion

Let's update the [Projects (Classic) on GitHub](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/how-to-setup-your-project.md#projects-classic-on-github) section in the "How to Set Up Your Project" chapter to Projects</td>

## Description

There are several things that need to be updated on the README based on following reasons:

- There is no link to each chapter in the "Course Overview" section.
- CodeSee is no longer available.
- We've updated the "Types of Contributions" title to "Types of Open Source Contributions".

## Suggested Solution

In the [`README.md` of Intro to Open Source course](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/README.md?plain=1):

- [ ] Provide relative path **to each chapter** in the "Course Overview" section as example below:

   ```markdown
   ### [1. What is Open Source?](what-is-open-source.md)
   ```

- [ ] Omit CodeSee by updating the wording in line 33 as below:

   ```markdown
   Discover the key tools and platforms necessary for a successful journey in open source development. From Git and GitHub for version control and VS Code as your code editor, this chapter provides an overview of how to leverage these essential tools.
   ```

- [ ] Change the title in line 43 as below:

   ```markdown
   ### Types of Open Source Contributions
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Please run the project locally to test the links. They should go to the correct chapters.

### Description

There is a duplication of the term "Docs" in our Glossary. Another thing, the example that's given here is not quite accurate.

### Suggested Solution

In the [`10-glossary.md`](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/glossary.md?plain=1) file:

- [ ] Delete the duplication (line 45-48).

- [ ] Update the wording in line 23.

   ```markdown
   Docs is an abbreviation for "documentation". It primarily explains how to implement and use a product or an open source project. It also provides information on how to contribute to the project and expectations for contributors. Documentation is often written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), a lightweight markup language.
   ```

      <td>### Describe the bug

Based on the [info on the docs](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/features/workspaces/#how-to-create-or-access-a-workspace) and the time I tested this feature to update the docs, clicking "Home" icon will bring users to the last workspace that they opened. It was because we were provided with the sidebar toggle on every tab we open. So, every time we toggle and open the sidebar from the "Explore" or "Highlights" tab and click the "Home" icon, we were redirected to the last workspace that we opened.

Now, clicking the "Home" icon will bring users to their personal workspace instead. We don't see the sidebar toggle on "Explore" and "Highlight" tabs anymore.
Clicking the OpenSauced logo or "Workspace" tab takes us to personal wokspace instead of the last workpace that we opened.

So, when we select a workspace, then navigate to another tab and get back to the "Workspace" tab, we will land in the personal workspace. The "Home" icon doesn't have function anymore here because personal workspace will be the only workspace that we opened the last.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Open a workspace.
2. Navigate to other tab (Explore or Highlights)
3. Navigate back to the Workspace tab.
4. You will see personal workspace.
5. Click the "Home" icon.
6. You will still stay on your personal workspace.
7. Repeat steps 1 & 2.
8. Click the OpenSauced logo.
9. You will see personal workspace.
10. Click the "Home" icon.
11. You will still stay on your personal workspace.

I'm not sure if this behavior is intentional or a bug.

Clicking the OpenSauced logo on mobile will open the Highlights feed. While on desktop, clicking the logo takes users to personal workspace.
I'm expecting to have the same behavior on mobile and desktop.

If this is intentional, we might need to update our docs to provide this information.


### Decive information

I'm using Samsung Galaxy S22 with Android 14

### Steps to reproduce

**Mobile**

1. Click the OpenSauced logo.
2. You will see the Highlights feed.

**Desktop**

1. Click the OpenSauced logo.
2. You will see the personal workspace page.

When creating a contributor insight page on mobile, the modal is not in full screen. This makes users difficult to navigate and understand what's going on with below details:

1. Users cannot see the methods to add contributors.
2. Users should enter the name of a contributor blindly and cannot see the suggestions.
3. The add button is cut off, so users cannot see what kind of button it is.

I'm using Samsung Galaxy S22 with Android 14.

### Steps to reproduce

On mobile phone:

1. Go to the target workspace and create a new contributor insight.
2. After clicking the "Add contributors" button, you will be prompted to the modal to add contributor.
3. From here onwards, you will see that the modal is not on full screen and difficult to understand and navigate.

<p>When an error is thrown, the special <code>src/pages/500.astro</code> page now automatically receives the error as a prop. This allows you to display more specific information about the error on a custom 500 page.</p>
<pre lang="astro"><code>---
// src/pages/500.astro
interface Props {
  error: unknown;
}
<h2>const { error } = Astro.props;</h2>
<p>&lt;div&gt;{error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></p>
<p>If an error occurs rendering this page, your host's default 500 error page will be shown to your visitor in production, and Astro's default error overlay will be shown in development.</p>

<h2>8.17.1</h2>
<h1>Bug fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a DoS vulnerability (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2231">#2231</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>A request with a number of headers exceeding the[<code>server.maxHeadersCount</code>][]
threshold could be used to crash a ws server.</p>
<pre lang="js"><code>const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');
<p>const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {
const chars = &quot;!#$%&amp;'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~&quot;.split('');
const headers = {};
let count = 0;</p>
<p>for (let i = 0; i &lt; chars.length; i++) {
if (count === 2000) break;</p>
<pre><code>for (let j = 0; j &amp;lt; chars.length; j++) {
  const key = chars[i] + chars[j];
  headers[key] = 'x';

  if (++count === 2000) break;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';
headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';
headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';
headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';</p>
<p>const request = http.request({
headers: headers,
host: '127.0.0.1',
port: wss.address().port
});</p>
<p>request.end();
});
</code></pre></p>
<p>The vulnerability was reported by <a href="https://github.com/rrlapointe">Ryan LaPointe</a> in <a href="https://redirect.github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230">websockets/ws#2230</a>.</p>
<p>In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the
[<code>--max-http-header-size=size</code>][] and/or the [<code>maxHeaderSize</code>][] options so
that no more headers than the <code>server.maxHeadersCount</code> limit can be sent.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://redirect.github.com/withastro/astro/pull/10974">#10974</a> <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/2668ef984104574f25f29ef75e2572a0745d1666"><code>2668ef9</code></a> Thanks <a href="https://github.com/florian-lefebvre"><code>@​florian-lefebvre</code></a>! - Adds experimental support for the <code>astro:env</code> API.</p>
<p>The <code>astro:env</code> API lets you configure a type-safe schema for your environment variables, and indicate whether they should be available on the server or the client. Import and use your defined variables from the appropriate <code>/client</code> or <code>/server</code> module:</p>
<pre lang="astro"><code>---
import { PUBLIC_APP_ID } from 'astro:env/client';
import { PUBLIC_API_URL, getSecret } from 'astro:env/server';
const API_TOKEN = getSecret('API_TOKEN');
<h2>const data = await fetch(<code>${PUBLIC_API_URL}/users</code>, {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
Authorization: <code>Bearer ${API_TOKEN}</code>,
},
body: JSON.stringify({ appId: PUBLIC_APP_ID }),
});</h2>
<p></code></pre></p>
<p>To define the data type and properties of your environment variables, declare a schema in your Astro config in <code>experimental.env.schema</code>. The <code>envField</code> helper allows you define your variable as a string, number, or boolean and pass properties in an object:</p>
<pre lang="js"><code>// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig, envField } from 'astro/config';
<p>export default defineConfig({
experimental: {
env: {
schema: {
PUBLIC_API_URL: envField.string({ context: 'client', access: 'public', optional: true }),
PUBLIC_PORT: envField.number({ context: 'server', access: 'public', default: 4321 }),
API_SECRET: envField.string({ context: 'server', access: 'secret' }),
},
},
</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>astro:env</code> API lets you configure a type-safe schema for your environment variables, and indicate whether they should be available on the server or the client. Import and use your defined variables from the appropriate <code>/client</code> or <code>/server</code> module:</p>
<pre lang="astro"><code>---
import { PUBLIC_APP_ID } from 'astro:env/client';
import { PUBLIC_API_URL, getSecret } from 'astro:env/server';
const API_TOKEN = getSecret('API_TOKEN');
<h2>const data = await fetch(<code>${PUBLIC_API_URL}/users</code>, {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
Authorization: <code>Bearer ${API_TOKEN}</code>,
},
body: JSON.stringify({ appId: PUBLIC_APP_ID }),
});</h2>
<p></code></pre></p>
<p>To define the data type and properties of your environment variables, declare a schema in your Astro config in <code>experimental.env.schema</code>. The <code>envField</code> helper allows you define your variable as a string, number, or boolean and pass properties in an object:</p>
<pre lang="js"><code>// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig, envField } from 'astro/config';
<p>export default defineConfig({
experimental: {
env: {
schema: {
PUBLIC_API_URL: envField.string({ context: 'client', access: 'public', optional: true }),
PUBLIC_PORT: envField.number({ context: 'server', access: 'public', default: 4321 }),
API_SECRET: envField.string({ context: 'server', access: 'secret' }),
</code></pre></p>

<p><a href="https://redirect.github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11051">#11051</a> <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/12a1bccc818af292cdd2a8ed0f3e3c042b9819b4"><code>12a1bcc</code></a> Thanks <a href="https://github.com/ematipico"><code>@​ematipico</code></a>! - Introduces an experimental Container API to render <code>.astro</code> components in isolation.</p>
<p>This API introduces three new functions to allow you to create a new container and render an Astro component returning either a string or a Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>create()</code>: creates a new instance of the container.</li>
<li><code>renderToString()</code>: renders a component and return a string.</li>
<li><code>renderToResponse()</code>: renders a component and returns the <code>Response</code> emitted by the rendering phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first supported use of this new API is to enable unit testing. For example, with <code>vitest</code>, you can create a container to render your component with test data and check the result:</p>
<pre lang="js"><code>import { experimental_AstroContainer as AstroContainer } from 'astro/container';
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import Card from '../src/components/Card.astro';
<p>test('Card with slots', async () =&gt; {
const container = await AstroContainer.create();
const result = await container.renderToString(Card, {
slots: {
default: 'Card content',
},
});</p>
<p>expect(result).toContain('This is a card');
expect(result).toContain('Card content');

<p><a href="https://redirect.github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11051">#11051</a> <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/12a1bccc818af292cdd2a8ed0f3e3c042b9819b4"><code>12a1bcc</code></a> Thanks <a href="https://github.com/ematipico"><code>@​ematipico</code></a>! - Introduces an experimental Container API to render <code>.astro</code> components in isolation.</p>
<p>This API introduces three new functions to allow you to create a new container and render an Astro component returning either a string or a Response:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>create()</code>: creates a new instance of the container.</li>
<li><code>renderToString()</code>: renders a component and return a string.</li>
<li><code>renderToResponse()</code>: renders a component and returns the <code>Response</code> emitted by the rendering phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first supported use of this new API is to enable unit testing. For example, with <code>vitest</code>, you can create a container to render your component with test data and check the result:</p>
<pre lang="js"><code>import { experimental_AstroContainer as AstroContainer } from 'astro/container';
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import Card from '../src/components/Card.astro';
<p>test('Card with slots', async () =&gt; {
const container = await AstroContainer.create();
const result = await container.renderToString(Card, {
slots: {
default: 'Card content',
},
});</p>
<p>expect(result).toContain('This is a card');
expect(result).toContain('Card content');
});

These new utilities abstract away some of the boilerplate code that is common in toolbar apps, and lower the barrier of entry for app authors.</p>
<p>For example, instead of creating an event listener for the <code>app-toggled</code> event and manually typing the value in the callback, you can now use the <code>onAppToggled</code> method. Additionally, communicating with the server does not require knowing any of the Vite APIs anymore, as a new <code>server</code> object is passed to the <code>init</code> function that contains easy to use methods for communicating with the server.</p>

<p>Instead of having to provision resources directly from the config, we'd like to bind to existing resources in users' CF accounts. For example, you have an R2 bucket that you'd like to access from your partykit project. Now, you can add this to your <code>partykit.json</code>:</p>
<pre lang="jsonc"><code>{
  //...
  &quot;bindings&quot;: {
    &quot;r2&quot;: {
      &quot;myBucket&quot;: &quot;my-bucket-name&quot;,
    },
  },
}
</code></pre>
<p>Inside your project, you can now access the r2 bucket with <code>room.context.bindings.r2.myBucket</code> (or <code>lobby.bindings.r2.myBucket</code>).</p>
<p>We'll add more types of bindings in the near future.</p>

      <td>## Description
This PR adds a section to the Maintainers Guide on growing open source projects. It will give maintainers an idea on how OpenSauced can help them with this process. 

## What I have done so far
> * [x]  Add `growing-your-project.md` to `docs > maintainers`
> * [x]  In `sidebar.js`, add `maintainers/growing-your-project' path below the guide:  "[maintainers/maintainers-guide-to-open-sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs/blob/a7b4fea2d1f3070d3765db64dd5b4f11a429d4f4/sidebars.js#L38C56-L38C56)",
> * [x]  In `growing-your-project.md`, create the following sections:
>   
>   * [x]  When to grow your project (brief explanation of need to get more contributors or add people to teams (maintainers, triage, docs)
>   * [x]  How to identify new contributors and team members
>     
>     * [x]  Look at existing contributors. How is there participation? Are they engaged? Are they invested in the success of the project?
>     * [x]  Create an insight page with your projects. Add the most active contributors to a list.
>   * [x]  Recruiting team members and contributors
>     
>     * [x]  	Create an insight page with projects similar to yours. Add contributors you think might be a good fit to a list. After spending some time monitoring, reach out to them.
>   * [x]  Understanding Team Participation.
>     
>     * [x]  It's important to monitor team participation. Once you have someone on a team, add them to your list to monitor your participation. (Use the team sync feature -- link to the gif). It's useful to set a timeframe for how active they need to be.
