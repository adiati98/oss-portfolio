      <td>### Suggested solution<br><br>## Background<br><br>As I&#39;m trying to find a way to create a base for our community translations, it gave me a thought.<br><br>So far, I don&#39;t see any open source project that has contributing & translation guidelines chapters on their live website. Usually, they have either:<br><br>   - &quot;Edit this page on GH&quot; that bring folks to the page file on GH, or<br>   - Link to the repo on GH.<br><br>   But we do have [contributing guidelines](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/CONTRIBUTING) and [translations guidelines](http://localhost:3000/#/i18n-guidelines) live on our website. I think it makes more sense if these files live _only_ in the repo.<br><br>For that reason, I propose to move `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `i18n-guidelines.md` to the root. We will still link these on the homepage of the course.<br><br>### Alternative<br><br>If we want to be a bit more organized, we can follow GH docs repo. They have a [contributing folder](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/contributing) that contains various contributing guidelines. So we can create a `contributing` folder at the root and move the guidelines files into this folder.<br><br>## Community Translations<br><br>In the forked repo of translations, they will have these in their root:<br><br>- Translated `CONTRIBUTING.md`.<br>- Translated `i18n-guidelines.md`.<br>- A contributing file that contains guidelines to contribute to the forked repo.<br><br>   They can name it anything, but preferably consistent across forked repos for documentation matter. So, maybe something like: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-LANG.md` and change the `LANG` to the translated languange. For example: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-ES.md`. They can link this file in the README on the root. This file can be upper- or lower-case. It doesn&#39;t matter as there is no convention for this. However, we want this to be consistent across forked repos.<br><br></td>

      <td>### Describe the bug<br><br>Based on the [info on the docs](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/features/workspaces/#how-to-create-or-access-a-workspace) and the time I tested this feature to update the docs, clicking &quot;Home&quot; icon will bring users to the last workspace that they opened. It was because we were provided with the sidebar toggle on every tab we open. So, every time we toggle and open the sidebar from the &quot;Explore&quot; or &quot;Highlights&quot; tab and click the &quot;Home&quot; icon, we were redirected to the last workspace that we opened.<br><br>Now, clicking the &quot;Home&quot; icon will bring users to their personal workspace instead. We don&#39;t see the sidebar toggle on &quot;Explore&quot; and &quot;Highlight&quot; tabs anymore.<br>Clicking the OpenSauced logo or &quot;Workspace&quot; tab takes us to personal wokspace instead of the last workpace that we opened.<br><br>So, when we select a workspace, then navigate to another tab and get back to the &quot;Workspace&quot; tab, we will land in the personal workspace. The &quot;Home&quot; icon doesn&#39;t have function anymore here because personal workspace will be the only workspace that we opened the last.<br><br><br>### Steps to reproduce<br><br>1. Open a workspace.<br>2. Navigate to other tab (Explore or Highlights)<br>3. Navigate back to the Workspace tab.<br>4. You will see personal workspace.<br>5. Click the &quot;Home&quot; icon.<br>6. You will still stay on your personal workspace.<br>7. Repeat steps 1 & 2.<br>8. Click the OpenSauced logo.<br>9. You will see personal workspace.<br>10. Click the &quot;Home&quot; icon.<br>11. You will still stay on your personal workspace. <br><br>### Do you have any images or screen captures?<br><br>![clicking home icon](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/56ac802e-8697-4ee8-b30b-6b6f426bff0e)<br><br><br>### Browsers<br><br>Chrome<br><br>### Additional context (Is this in dev or production?)<br><br>production<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [X] I agree to follow this project&#39;s Code of Conduct<br><br>### Contributing Docs<br><br>- [ ] I agree to follow this project&#39;s Contribution Docs</td>

These new utilities abstract away some of the boilerplate code that is common in toolbar apps, and lower the barrier of entry for app authors.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of creating an event listener for the &lt;code&gt;app-toggled&lt;/code&gt; event and manually typing the value in the callback, you can now use the &lt;code&gt;onAppToggled&lt;/code&gt; method. Additionally, communicating with the server does not require knowing any of the Vite APIs anymore, as a new &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; object is passed to the &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; function that contains easy to use methods for communicating with the server.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;pre lang=&quot;diff&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { defineToolbarApp } from &quot;astro/toolbar&quot;;<br>&lt;p&gt;export default defineToolbarApp({<br>init(canvas, app, server) {&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;app.addEventListener(&quot;app-toggled&quot;, (e) =&gt; {&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; console.log(`App is now ${state ? &amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot;}`);.<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;});&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;app.onToggled(({ state }) =&gt; {&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   console.log(`App is now ${state ? &amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot;}`);<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;});&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;if (import.meta.hot) {&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; import.meta.hot.send(&amp;quot;my-app:my-client-event&amp;quot;, { message: &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; });<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;server.send(&quot;my-app:my-client-event&quot;, { message: &quot;world&quot; })&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;if (import.meta.hot) {&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; import.meta.hot.on(&amp;quot;my-server-event&amp;quot;, (data: {message: string}) =&amp;gt; {<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   console.log(data.message);<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; });<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;server.on&lt;{ message: string }&gt;(&quot;my-server-event&quot;, (data) =&gt; {&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; console.log(data.message); // data is typed using the type parameter<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;});<br>},<br>})<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Server helpers are also available on the server side, for use in your integrations, through the new &lt;code&gt;toolbar&lt;/code&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;pre lang=&quot;ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;astro:server:setup&quot;: ({ toolbar }) =&gt; {<br>  toolbar.on&lt;{ message: string }&gt;(&quot;my-app:my-client-event&quot;, (data) =&gt; {<br>    console.log(data.message);<br>    toolbar.send(&quot;my-server-event&quot;, { message: &quot;hello&quot; });<br>  });<br>}<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;<br>&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;...
