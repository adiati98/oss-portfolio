But as the intro repository evolves, the contributing guidelines in this repo is no longer 100% accurate. Therefore, it needs to be updated.<br><br>Another reason is as Hacktoberfest is approaching, we want to make this repo ready for contributions not only from the course participants, but also from folks who don&#39;t take our Intro to OSS course.<br><br>## Suggested Solution<br><br>### Alternative 1<br><br>Update the contributing guidelines by adding instructions from [Let&#39;s Get Practical](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section and adjust other sections accordingly.<br><br>### Alternative 2<br><br>Remove the contributing guidelines completely with below reasons:<br><br>- We have the [Getting Started](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section on the README that navigate folks to the instructions of adding themselves to the guestbook.<br>- The [Contributing](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributing) section on the README already holds the information for folks to improve our Intro to OSS course. </td>

      <td>### Suggested solution<br><br>## Background<br><br>As I&#39;m trying to find a way to create a base for our community translations, it gave me a thought.<br><br>So far, I don&#39;t see any open source project that has contributing & translation guidelines chapters on their live website. Usually, they have either:<br><br>   - &quot;Edit this page on GH&quot; that bring folks to the page file on GH, or<br>   - Link to the repo on GH.<br><br>   But we do have [contributing guidelines](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/CONTRIBUTING) and [translations guidelines](http://localhost:3000/#/i18n-guidelines) live on our website. I think it makes more sense if these files live _only_ in the repo.<br><br>For that reason, I propose to move `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `i18n-guidelines.md` to the root. We will still link these on the homepage of the course.<br><br>### Alternative<br><br>If we want to be a bit more organized, we can follow GH docs repo. They have a [contributing folder](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/contributing) that contains various contributing guidelines. So we can create a `contributing` folder at the root and move the guidelines files into this folder.<br><br>## Community Translations<br><br>In the forked repo of translations, they will have these in their root:<br><br>- Translated `CONTRIBUTING.md`.<br>- Translated `i18n-guidelines.md`.<br>- A contributing file that contains guidelines to contribute to the forked repo.<br><br>   They can name it anything, but preferably consistent across forked repos for documentation matter. So, maybe something like: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-LANG.md` and change the `LANG` to the translated languange. For example: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-ES.md`. They can link this file in the README on the root. This file can be upper- or lower-case. It doesn&#39;t matter as there is no convention for this. However, we want this to be consistent across forked repos.<br><br></td>

      <td>### Describe the bug<br><br>Based on the [info on the docs](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/features/workspaces/#how-to-create-or-access-a-workspace) and the time I tested this feature to update the docs, clicking &quot;Home&quot; icon will bring users to the last workspace that they opened. It was because we were provided with the sidebar toggle on every tab we open. So, every time we toggle and open the sidebar from the &quot;Explore&quot; or &quot;Highlights&quot; tab and click the &quot;Home&quot; icon, we were redirected to the last workspace that we opened.<br><br>Now, clicking the &quot;Home&quot; icon will bring users to their personal workspace instead. We don&#39;t see the sidebar toggle on &quot;Explore&quot; and &quot;Highlight&quot; tabs anymore.<br>Clicking the OpenSauced logo or &quot;Workspace&quot; tab takes us to personal wokspace instead of the last workpace that we opened.<br><br>So, when we select a workspace, then navigate to another tab and get back to the &quot;Workspace&quot; tab, we will land in the personal workspace. The &quot;Home&quot; icon doesn&#39;t have function anymore here because personal workspace will be the only workspace that we opened the last.<br><br><br>### Steps to reproduce<br><br>1. Open a workspace.<br>2. Navigate to other tab (Explore or Highlights)<br>3. Navigate back to the Workspace tab.<br>4. You will see personal workspace.<br>5. Click the &quot;Home&quot; icon.<br>6.

      <td>This kind of overlaps with multiple sections, so I&#39;m happy to take feedback here. But I think there are different types of documentation.<br><br>So far, we cover readmes, cocs, contributing files. I think this section can talk about more technical aspects of documentation.  We can cover some of the stuff [here](https://dev.to/opensauced/the-role-of-documentation-in-open-source-success-2lbn), but also talk about<br><br>- User Documentation: Guides, tutorials, and FAQs for end-users.<br>- API Documentation: Detailed information about the APIs, for developers who want to use or integrate with your project.<br>- Developer Documentation: This includes setup guides, contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and development practices, crucial for new contributors.<br><br>Documentation should be clear, concise, and accessible to both technical and non-technical users. Avoid jargon and explain complex concepts in simple terms.<br>Documentation should be kept up-to-date with the latest changes in the project. Outdated documentation can be misleading and frustrating for users and contributors. </td>
