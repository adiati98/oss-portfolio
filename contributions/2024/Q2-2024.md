A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Description

This PR adds June 2024 challenge (Mid-Year Check-In) to the website.

### Live Preview

https://deploy-preview-1185--virtual-coffee-io.netlify.app/monthlychallenges

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR mainly fixes the relative paths that lead to 404 in GitHub. They're still working as intended on the website.

Along the fixes, this PR also holds the following changes:

- Added relative paths to the &quot;next chapter&quot; term in the last paragraph of each chapter for better navigation on GitHub. In the case of no last paragraph, I added a sentence for navigation.
- Added relative paths to the chapter titles on README (for consistency with the future Maintainers course) and `intro.md`.
- Restructured the sidebar by moving the &quot;Conclusion&quot; chapter to before &quot;Additional Resouces&quot; for better flow.

### Note

@BekahHW I've tested the relative paths on a private repo and they work well.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

We recently migrated this project from docsify to Docusaurs. With this change, we also need to update the [instructions to run the project locally](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-project-locally) in the contributing guidelines.</td>

      <td>## Description

As this repository is completely to add contributors to the guestbook with minimum information and we're moving translations at the Open Sauced Education Path to be Community Translations, we don't need to translate anything here. Therefore, the translation guidelines is not necessary.

## Suggested Solution

- Remove the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Remove the &quot;Translations&quot; list from the [Contributing](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributing) section on the README.</td>

      <td>## Description

As part of Intro to OSS course, the contributing guidelines in this guestbook repo is following and being adjusted from the guidelines at the intro repository. But as the intro repository evolves, the contributing guidelines in this repo is no longer 100% accurate. Therefore, it needs to be updated.

Another reason is as Hacktoberfest is approaching, we want to make this repo ready for contributions not only from the course participants, but also from folks who don't take our Intro to OSS course.

## Suggested Solution

### Alternative 1

Update the contributing guidelines by adding instructions from [Let's Get Practical](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section and adjust other sections accordingly.

### Alternative 2

Remove the contributing guidelines completely with below reasons:

- We have the [Getting Started](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section on the README that navigate folks to the instructions of adding themselves to the guestbook.
- The [Contributing](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributing) section on the README already holds the information for folks to improve our Intro to OSS course. </td>

      <td>### Suggested solution

## Description

As per discussion, moving forward, we will have all translations as &quot;Community Translations&quot;. 

Having our community to translate and host the translations on their forked repo will give them below benefits:

- They will have the opportunity to learn to maintain a project, nurture a community, and become the maintainer of the translation as it will live in their forked repo,
- They can make the the translation available soonest,
- They can update the translation faster as they are able to review and merge in PRs themselves as a maintainer.

## Suggested Solution

We need to update the translation guidelines to hold the content of community translations, for example, how to structure their forked repo, update the translations with the current state of the English version, and self-host the website.

We also need to update pages that include these guidelines such as README, etc.

      <td>### Suggested solution

## Background

As I'm trying to find a way to create a base for our community translations, it gave me a thought.

So far, I don't see any open source project that has contributing & translation guidelines chapters on their live website. Usually, they have either:

   - &quot;Edit this page on GH&quot; that bring folks to the page file on GH, or
   - Link to the repo on GH.

   But we do have [contributing guidelines](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/CONTRIBUTING) and [translations guidelines](http://localhost:3000/#/i18n-guidelines) live on our website. I think it makes more sense if these files live _only_ in the repo.

For that reason, I propose to move `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `i18n-guidelines.md` to the root. We will still link these on the homepage of the course.

### Alternative

If we want to be a bit more organized, we can follow GH docs repo. They have a [contributing folder](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/contributing) that contains various contributing guidelines. So we can create a `contributing` folder at the root and move the guidelines files into this folder.

## Community Translations

In the forked repo of translations, they will have these in their root:

- Translated `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Translated `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- A contributing file that contains guidelines to contribute to the forked repo.

   They can name it anything, but preferably consistent across forked repos for documentation matter. So, maybe something like: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-LANG.md` and change the `LANG` to the translated languange. For example: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-ES.md`. They can link this file in the README on the root. This file can be upper- or lower-case. It doesn't matter as there is no convention for this. However, we want this to be consistent across forked repos.

      <td><a href='https://github.com/OpenSource-Communities/intro/issues/205'>Feature: Add a README and move the LICENSE file to the root</a></td>
      <td>### Suggested solution

### README

The README that's available at the moment is coming from the `docs`, which is the homepage of &quot;The Open Source Education with OpenSauced&quot;.

Adding a README dedicated for the repo will have these benefits:

- Make it consistence with other OpenSauced repos where there is a logo and contains information about the repository itself.
- Considering that we will have community translations that live in forked repos, these translations has a place to link their contributing guidelines (to contribute to the forked repo) on the README.

### LICENSE

Although we have a section for license in the README, there is no license can be found In the &quot;About&quot; section on the sidebar of the repo as per screenshot below.

This is because the file is located in the `docs` folder. We need to move this file to the root of the project.

This repo is meant for our intro course participants to continue their learning by adding pizza-related information. Even though pizza is a favorite to most people, adding pizza-related information would be hard for folks who don't have interest in pizzas. We might want to add something else to this repo to spark interest for our course participants in continuing their learning.

## Suggested Solution

Let's allow folks to add their favorite foods from their own countries! In international space, folks usually love to talk about their country, culture, and even their traditional foods. By allowing them to add this, we might be able to encourage folks to contribute further. 

We will need:

- [x] A new file called `world-traditional-foods.md`.
- [x] An example in the file.
- [x] A new open issue.
- [x] Information about this addition in the README.

      <td>### Describe the bug

Recently, there is an update where users can highlight blog posts that they published outside Dev.to.
However, the placeholder is still mentioning to paste Dev.to URL only for blog post highlight.

Current placeholder:

  
![placeholder to paste URL at OpenSauced app](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/1f405fd5-5931-4cb8-916a-af65126c0765)

We might want to update this placeholder to make users aware that they can now create highlight for blog posts that they published outside Dev.to.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Post a highlight.
2. You can see at the placeholder that says: &quot;Paste the URL to your PR, Issue, or Dev.to blog post&quot;.</td>

There are three things that needs clarification here:

- Reading the contributing guidelines is crucial when contributing to OSS projects.
- Having an issue accompanying a PR is one of the best practices in contributing to an OSS project.
- The instruction to create an issue in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=getting-started) section is not too clear for complete beginners.

Suggested Solutions:

- Emphasize the importance of reading guidelines before taking an issue.
- Add the importance of creating an issue in the &quot;[Getting Started With Contributing](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=getting-started-with-contributing)&quot; section.
- Breakdown the instruction of creating an issue in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=getting-started) section.</td>

We have a &quot;Job Seekers Guide&quot; in our docs that is suitable to be added into the &quot;Intro to Open Source&quot; course.

### Suggested solution

In line 75 in the [`docs/intro-to-oss/the-secret-sauce.md`](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/the-secret-sauce.md), add a sentence at the end with copy as follow:

Additionally, you can refer to the [Job Seekers Guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/opensauced-guides/job-seekers-guide/job-seekers-guide-introduction/) on our docs to learn how to use OpenSauced to land a job in the tech industry.

Here are the background:

- There is no main title in the &quot;Additional Resources&quot; page.

- [ ] Add a main title on the first line.

   ```markdown
   # Additional Resources

When I wanted to delete a couple of Contributor Insight Pages in a row, I couldn't do it without refreshing the page.

Here is what I did:

- After deleting a page, I wanted to delete another page.
- I typed the page name that I want to delete, but clicking the &quot;Delete&quot; button didn't do anything.
- Clicking the &quot;x&quot; icon to clear the name also didn't work.
- Only the &quot;Cancel&quot; button worked.
- I tried one more time with the same result.
- This finally worked after I refreshed the page.


### Steps to reproduce

1. In the sidebar, click the &quot;Show all&quot; option for Contributor Insights.
2. Click &quot;bin&quot; icon and delete a page.
3. Click &quot;bin&quot; icon to delete another page.
4. Type the page name and click the &quot;Delete&quot; button. You will see that nothing happen.
5. Click the &quot;x&quot; icon next to the name to clear the input. Nothing happens.
6. Click the &quot;Cancel&quot; button. It will take you back to the list.
7. Repeat step 3 - 6. Nothing will happen.
8. Refresh the page and repeat step 3 - 4.
9. Now it deletes the page as it should.

GitHub is moving away from Projects (classic) to Projects.

As mentioned on [the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards):

&gt; You can only create a new project (classic) for an organization or user that already has at least one project (classic). You cannot create new projects (classic) for repositories. If you're unable to create a project (classic), create a project instead.

In my own recent experience, I can't create a project (classic) anymore, although I have several projects (classic).

## Suggestion

Let's update the [Projects (Classic) on GitHub](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/how-to-setup-your-project.md#projects-classic-on-github) section in the &quot;How to Set Up Your Project&quot; chapter to Projects</td>

- CodeSee is no longer available.
- We've updated the &quot;Types of Contributions&quot; title to &quot;Types of Open Source Contributions&quot;.

## Suggested Solution

In the [`README.md` of Intro to Open Source course](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/README.md?plain=1):

- [ ] Provide relative path **to each chapter** in the &quot;Course Overview&quot; section as example below:

   ```markdown
   ### [1. What is Open Source?](what-is-open-source.md)
   ```

- [ ] Omit CodeSee by updating the wording in line 33 as below:

   ```markdown
   Discover the key tools and platforms necessary for a successful journey in open source development. From Git and GitHub for version control and VS Code as your code editor, this chapter provides an overview of how to leverage these essential tools.
   ```

- [ ] Change the title in line 43 as below:

   ```markdown
   ### Types of Open Source Contributions
   ```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Please run the project locally to test the links. They should go to the correct chapters.

In the [`10-glossary.md`](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/glossary.md?plain=1) file:

- [ ] Delete the duplication (line 45-48).

   https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/58145c60827b4dedec3508928e25bb92c4047d55/docs/intro-to-oss/glossary.md?plain=1#L45-L48
- [ ] Update the wording in line 23.

   ```markdown
   Docs is an abbreviation for &quot;documentation&quot;. It primarily explains how to implement and use a product or an open source project. It also provides information on how to contribute to the project and expectations for contributors. Documentation is often written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), a lightweight markup language.
   ```

   Line to be updated:
   https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/58145c60827b4dedec3508928e25bb92c4047d55/docs/intro-to-oss/glossary.md?plain=1#L23


### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/intro-to-oss/glossary
2. You will see the duplication of the term &quot;Docs&quot;.

      <td>### Describe the bug

Based on the [info on the docs](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/features/workspaces/#how-to-create-or-access-a-workspace) and the time I tested this feature to update the docs, clicking &quot;Home&quot; icon will bring users to the last workspace that they opened. It was because we were provided with the sidebar toggle on every tab we open. So, every time we toggle and open the sidebar from the &quot;Explore&quot; or &quot;Highlights&quot; tab and click the &quot;Home&quot; icon, we were redirected to the last workspace that we opened.

Now, clicking the &quot;Home&quot; icon will bring users to their personal workspace instead. We don't see the sidebar toggle on &quot;Explore&quot; and &quot;Highlight&quot; tabs anymore.
Clicking the OpenSauced logo or &quot;Workspace&quot; tab takes us to personal wokspace instead of the last workpace that we opened.

So, when we select a workspace, then navigate to another tab and get back to the &quot;Workspace&quot; tab, we will land in the personal workspace. The &quot;Home&quot; icon doesn't have function anymore here because personal workspace will be the only workspace that we opened the last.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Open a workspace.
2. Navigate to other tab (Explore or Highlights)
3. Navigate back to the Workspace tab.
4. You will see personal workspace.
5. Click the &quot;Home&quot; icon.
6. You will still stay on your personal workspace.
7. Repeat steps 1 & 2.
8. Click the OpenSauced logo.
9. You will see personal workspace.
10. Click the &quot;Home&quot; icon.
11. You will still stay on your personal workspace.

      <td>### Describe the bug

I'm not sure if this behavior is intentional or a bug.

Clicking the OpenSauced logo on mobile will open the Highlights feed. While on desktop, clicking the logo takes users to personal workspace.
I'm expecting to have the same behavior on mobile and desktop.

If this is intentional, we might need to update our docs to provide this information.

### Steps to reproduce

**Mobile**

1. Click the OpenSauced logo.
2. You will see the Highlights feed.

**Desktop**

1. Click the OpenSauced logo.
2. You will see the personal workspace page.

      <td>### Describe the bug

When creating a contributor insight page on mobile, the modal is not in full screen. This makes users difficult to navigate and understand what's going on with below details:

1. Users cannot see the methods to add contributors.
2. Users should enter the name of a contributor blindly and cannot see the suggestions.
3. The add button is cut off, so users cannot see what kind of button it is.

### Device information

I'm using Samsung Galaxy S22 with Android 14.

### Steps to reproduce

On mobile phone:

1. Go to the target workspace and create a new contributor insight.
2. After clicking the &quot;Add contributors&quot; button, you will be prompted to the modal to add contributor.
3. From here onwards, you will see that the modal is not on full screen and difficult to understand and navigate.

When I added a highlight from the &quot;Highlights&quot; tab on my profile page, it didn't add the highlight immediately to the list. But it did show when clicking the &quot;Highlights&quot; tab on the navbar. However, it finally showed on my profile 15 minutes later.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the profile page
2. Create a highlight at the &quot;Highlights&quot; tab.
3. You won't see the newly created highlight on the list. But there is a notification that highlight is successfully added.
4. Click the &quot;Highlights&quot; tab on the navbar.
5. You will see the newly created highlight here.
6. Back to your profile and click the &quot;Highlights&quot; tab.
7. You still won't see the highlight.
8. Get back to it around 15 minutes later.
9. You will now see the highlight.

Per [@adiati98's suggestion in #262](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs/pull/262#discussion_r1510417882), the following change need to be done:

      <td>This kind of overlaps with multiple sections, so I'm happy to take feedback here. But I think there are different types of documentation.

So far, we cover readmes, cocs, contributing files. I think this section can talk about more technical aspects of documentation.  We can cover some of the stuff [here](https://dev.to/opensauced/the-role-of-documentation-in-open-source-success-2lbn), but also talk about

- User Documentation: Guides, tutorials, and FAQs for end-users.
- API Documentation: Detailed information about the APIs, for developers who want to use or integrate with your project.
- Developer Documentation: This includes setup guides, contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and development practices, crucial for new contributors.

Documentation should be clear, concise, and accessible to both technical and non-technical users. Avoid jargon and explain complex concepts in simple terms.
Documentation should be kept up-to-date with the latest changes in the project. Outdated documentation can be misleading and frustrating for users and contributors. </td>
