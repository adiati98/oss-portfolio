&lt;!--

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Linked Issue

Relates to #1196

If you have a pull request related to a current issue please link to that issue number.

That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword &quot;Closes&quot; followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

--&gt;

## Description

This PR adds a blog post for July 2024 challenge and updates wording in the challenge page.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

As our website has migrated from Remix to NextJS, there are changes in the folders structure. We also now use `.tsx` instead of `.jsx` for our monthly challenges files. 

## Suggestions

Update the instructions in the &quot;[Updating the Monthly Challenge Pages on the Website](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Contributors/blob/main/monthly-challenges/facilitators-docs.md#updating-the-monthly-challenge-pages-on-the-website)&quot; section in the `facilitators-docs.md` to reflect these changes.

      <td>## Description

In the &quot;[Tools to be Successful](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/tools-to-be-successful)&quot; chapter, we have this structure of sections:

```markdown
- GitHub & Git
   - Introduction to Git
   - Introduction to GitHub
   - Getting Started with Git and GitHub
- VS Code
```

The &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section starts with:

&gt; To get started with Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

There are instructions to setup Git, but no instruction to sign-up for GitHub.

This section has a subsection of &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section &quot;VS Code&quot; is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section.
- Move the &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; subsection right after &quot;VS Code&quot; section and make it the same heading level as &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; and &quot;VS Code&quot;.

## Solution

- [x] add directions on adding a highlight from the highlight suggestion. 
- [ ] Explain both the &quot;Fill content&quot; and &quot;Add and Summarize&quot; buttons
- [x] Remove the existing gif for the highlight
- [x] Create a new gif with one that shows the suggestions and name it &quot;highlight.gif&quot;. (The naming is important so we don't break anything that's been linked elsewhere.)

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

Not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but the nav bar is visible but not interactive on scroll up all the way up on the landing page. Also it stay visible if there is focus within.

I think the idea is to hide the bar when scrolled all the way up and reveal it later, right? But I scrolled too much and revealed the bar by mistake, I can't unsee it and I wanna press it üò≠ 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to https://virtualcoffee.io/
2. Scroll up for no reason

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

Chrome

### Environment

```markdown
- OS: MacOS Ventura 13.0
```


### Anything else?

I love issues forms, I didn't know we have them omg
