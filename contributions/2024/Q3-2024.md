## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR adds a blog post for July 2024 challenge and updates wording in the challenge page.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

If you have a pull request related to a current issue please link to that issue number.

That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword &quot;Closes&quot; followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

## Description

This PR adds a blog post for July 2024 challenge and updates wording in the challenge page.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

In the &quot;[Tools to be Successful](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/tools-to-be-successful)&quot; chapter, we have this structure of sections:

```markdown
- GitHub & Git
   - Introduction to Git
   - Introduction to GitHub
   - Getting Started with Git and GitHub
- VS Code
```

The &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section starts with:

&gt; To get started with Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

There are instructions to setup Git, but no instruction to sign-up for GitHub.

This section has a subsection of &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section &quot;VS Code&quot; is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section.
- Move the &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; subsection right after &quot;VS Code&quot; section and make it the same heading level as &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; and &quot;VS Code&quot;.

This section has a subsection of &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section &quot;VS Code&quot; is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section.
- Move the &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; subsection right after &quot;VS Code&quot; section and make it the same heading level as &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; and &quot;VS Code&quot;.

      <td>## Description

In the &quot;[Tools to be Successful](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/tools-to-be-successful)&quot; chapter, we have this structure of sections:

```markdown
- GitHub & Git
   - Introduction to Git
   - Introduction to GitHub
   - Getting Started with Git and GitHub
- VS Code
```

The &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section starts with:

&gt; To get started with Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

There are instructions to setup Git, but no instruction to sign-up for GitHub.

This section has a subsection of &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section &quot;VS Code&quot; is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section.
- Move the &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; subsection right after &quot;VS Code&quot; section and make it the same heading level as &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; and &quot;VS Code&quot;.

      <td>### Suggested solution

## Description

As per discussion, moving forward, we will have all translations as &quot;Community Translations&quot;. 

Having our community to translate and host the translations on their forked repo will give them below benefits:

- They will have the opportunity to learn to maintain a project, nurture a community, and become the maintainer of the translation as it will live in their forked repo,
- They can make the the translation available soonest,
- They can update the translation faster as they are able to review and merge in PRs themselves as a maintainer.

## Suggested Solution

We need to update the translation guidelines to hold the content of community translations, for example, how to structure their forked repo, update the translations with the current state of the English version, and self-host the website.

We also need to update pages that include these guidelines such as README, etc.

      <td>### Suggested solution

## Description

As per discussion, moving forward, we will have all translations as &quot;Community Translations&quot;. 

Having our community to translate and host the translations on their forked repo will give them below benefits:

- They will have the opportunity to learn to maintain a project, nurture a community, and become the maintainer of the translation as it will live in their forked repo,
- They can make the the translation available soonest,
- They can update the translation faster as they are able to review and merge in PRs themselves as a maintainer.

## Suggested Solution

We need to update the translation guidelines to hold the content of community translations, for example, how to structure their forked repo, update the translations with the current state of the English version, and self-host the website.

We also need to update pages that include these guidelines such as README, etc.

      <td>## Description

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over &quot;by hand.&quot;

## Steps to Update

In the code base, navigate to `app &gt; routes &gt; newsletter &gt; issues` and create a new file `2024-07.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `app &gt; routes &gt; newsletter &gt; issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in the [&quot;Newsletters&quot; section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

In the spirit of transparency and following the [update on our docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs/issues/318), let's put things where people can see them!

- Change Discord into Community with link https://github.com/orgs/open-sauced/discussions/1 in the `compliance.yml` 
- Remove an exclamation mark after the heart icon and a space from &quot;Open Sauced&quot;.

      <td>### Suggested solution

## Description

As per discussion, moving forward, we will have all translations as &quot;Community Translations&quot;. 

Having our community to translate and host the translations on their forked repo will give them below benefits:

- They will have the opportunity to learn to maintain a project, nurture a community, and become the maintainer of the translation as it will live in their forked repo,
- They can make the the translation available soonest,
- They can update the translation faster as they are able to review and merge in PRs themselves as a maintainer.

## Suggested Solution

We need to update the translation guidelines to hold the content of community translations, for example, how to structure their forked repo, update the translations with the current state of the English version, and self-host the website.

We also need to update pages that include these guidelines such as README, etc.
