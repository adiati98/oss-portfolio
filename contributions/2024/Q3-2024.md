You get the gist.<br><br>A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.<br><br>If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.<br><br>@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why.

That&#39;s fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.<br><br>If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it&#39;s always good to attach a document reference link for that information.<br><br>A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Code of Conduct<br><br>&gt; By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)<br></td>
