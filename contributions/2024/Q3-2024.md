      <td>## Description

As our website has migrated from Remix to NextJS, there are changes in the folders structure. We also now use `.tsx` instead of `.jsx` for our monthly challenges files. 

## Suggestions

Update the instructions in the "[Updating the Monthly Challenge Pages on the Website](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Contributors/blob/main/monthly-challenges/facilitators-docs.md#updating-the-monthly-challenge-pages-on-the-website)" section in the `facilitators-docs.md` to reflect these changes.

      <td>## Description

In the "[Tools to be Successful](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/tools-to-be-successful)" chapter, we have this structure of sections:

```markdown
- GitHub & Git
   - Introduction to Git
   - Introduction to GitHub
   - Getting Started with Git and GitHub
- VS Code
```

The "Getting Started with Git and GitHub" section starts with:

> To get started with Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

There are instructions to setup Git, but no instruction to sign-up for GitHub.

This section has a subsection of "Practicing Contributing with VS Code" which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section "VS Code" is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the "Getting Started with Git and GitHub" section.
- Move the "Practicing Contributing with VS Code" subsection right after "VS Code" section and make it the same heading level as "Getting Started with Git and GitHub" and "VS Code".
