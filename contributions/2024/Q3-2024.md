Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Description

This PR adds a blog post for July 2024 challenge and updates wording in the challenge page.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Description

This PR adds a blog post for July 2024 challenge and updates wording in the challenge page.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

In the &quot;[Tools to be Successful](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/tools-to-be-successful)&quot; chapter, we have this structure of sections:

```markdown
- GitHub & Git
   - Introduction to Git
   - Introduction to GitHub
   - Getting Started with Git and GitHub
- VS Code
```

The &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section starts with:

&gt; To get started with Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

There are instructions to setup Git, but no instruction to sign-up for GitHub.

This section has a subsection of &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section &quot;VS Code&quot; is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section.
- Move the &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; subsection right after &quot;VS Code&quot; section and make it the same heading level as &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; and &quot;VS Code&quot;.

The &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section starts with:

&gt; To get started with Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

There are instructions to setup Git, but no instruction to sign-up for GitHub.

This section has a subsection of &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section &quot;VS Code&quot; is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section.
- Move the &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; subsection right after &quot;VS Code&quot; section and make it the same heading level as &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; and &quot;VS Code&quot;.

      <td>## Description

In the &quot;[Tools to be Successful](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/tools-to-be-successful)&quot; chapter, we have this structure of sections:

```markdown
- GitHub & Git
   - Introduction to Git
   - Introduction to GitHub
   - Getting Started with Git and GitHub
- VS Code
```

The &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section starts with:

&gt; To get started with Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

There are instructions to setup Git, but no instruction to sign-up for GitHub.

This section has a subsection of &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section &quot;VS Code&quot; is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section.
- Move the &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; subsection right after &quot;VS Code&quot; section and make it the same heading level as &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; and &quot;VS Code&quot;.

      <td>## Description

As our website has migrated from Remix to NextJS, there are changes in the folders structure. We also now use `.tsx` instead of `.jsx` for our monthly challenges files. 

## Suggestions

Update the instructions in the &quot;[Updating the Monthly Challenge Pages on the Website](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Contributors/blob/main/monthly-challenges/facilitators-docs.md#updating-the-monthly-challenge-pages-on-the-website)&quot; section in the `facilitators-docs.md` to reflect these changes.

      <td>## Description

In the &quot;[Tools to be Successful](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/tools-to-be-successful)&quot; chapter, we have this structure of sections:

```markdown
- GitHub & Git
   - Introduction to Git
   - Introduction to GitHub
   - Getting Started with Git and GitHub
- VS Code
```

The &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section starts with:

&gt; To get started with Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

There are instructions to setup Git, but no instruction to sign-up for GitHub.

This section has a subsection of &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; which content a tutorial to create and clone a repo, make changes, and push them to GitHub.

However, the section &quot;VS Code&quot; is right after this subsection. So, it doesn't make sense to practice on VS Code before explaining it.

## Suggested Solution

- Add an instruction to sign up for GitHub in the &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; section.
- Move the &quot;Practicing Contributing with VS Code&quot; subsection right after &quot;VS Code&quot; section and make it the same heading level as &quot;Getting Started with Git and GitHub&quot; and &quot;VS Code&quot;.
