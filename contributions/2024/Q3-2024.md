Locators are also available on the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; object from &lt;code&gt;@vitest/browser/context&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;h3&gt;Potential Breaking Change&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;workspace&lt;/strong&gt;:<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Correctly resolve workspace globs and file paths  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sheremet-va&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​sheremet-va&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6316&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6316&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/afdcb8f2&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(afdcb)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;This changes how the custom glob pattern in the workspace config is treated. &lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; file matching the glob is considered a Vitest config file. Any folder matching the glob pattern is treated as a workspace project and is subject to the regular config resolution (single &lt;code&gt;vitest.config.ts&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;vite.config.ts&lt;/code&gt; inside the folder)&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;projects/*&lt;/code&gt; will match anything inside the &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt; folder. If it&#39;s a folder, we try to find the config inside that folder (if there is none, it is still treated as a project with the default config). If it&#39;s a file, it will be treated as a Vitest config. &lt;code&gt;projects/**/*&lt;/code&gt; previously would assume that you only wanted to have folders as projects, but now it will match &lt;em&gt;every single file&lt;/em&gt; inside&lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;This change doesn&#39;t affect non-glob usage.&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;h3&gt;   🚀 Features&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;api&lt;/strong&gt;:<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Make spec into a class instead of a tuple  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sheremet-va&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​sheremet-va&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6355&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6355&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/874a121e&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(874a1)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;browser&lt;/strong&gt;:<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Move page.config to server.config, add more docs  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sheremet-va&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​sheremet-va&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6252&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6252&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/af2b813c&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(af2b8)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Make iframe scalable, improve documentation  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sheremet-va&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​sheremet-va&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6257&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6257&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/74ca11a4&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(74ca1)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Introduce built-in locators  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sheremet-va&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​sheremet-va&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6084&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6084&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/3347f83e&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(3347f)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Support v8 coverage  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AriPerkkio&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​AriPerkkio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6273&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6273&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/34199bdf&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(34199)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Support &lt;code&gt;userEvent.upload&lt;/code&gt; in playwright provider  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sheremet-va&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​sheremet-va&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6442&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6442&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/cf148645&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(cf148)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Support &lt;code&gt;--inspect&lt;/code&gt;  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AriPerkkio&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​AriPerkkio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6433&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6433&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/0499a315&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(0499a)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Support &lt;code&gt;--inspect-brk&lt;/code&gt;  -  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AriPerkkio&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​AriPerkkio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/6434&quot;&gt;vitest-dev/vitest#6434&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/commit/7ab0f4a8&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(7ab0f)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;<br>&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;...

For example, a &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; function may return a user&#39;s session id to retrieve from your Astro frontmatter, rather than the entire user object.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;h2&gt;4.13.2&lt;/h2&gt;<br>&lt;h3&gt;Patch Changes&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11648&quot;&gt;#11648&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/589d35158da1a2136387d0ad76609f5c8535c03a&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;589d351&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bholmesdev&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​bholmesdev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! - Fixes unexpected error when refreshing a POST request from a form using Actions.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11600&quot;&gt;#11600&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/09ec2cadce01a9a1f9c54ac433f137348907aa56&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;09ec2ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ArmandPhilippot&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​ArmandPhilippot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! - Deprecates &lt;code&gt;getEntryBySlug&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getDataEntryById&lt;/code&gt; functions exported by &lt;code&gt;astro:content&lt;/code&gt; in favor of &lt;code&gt;getEntry&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11593&quot;&gt;#11593&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/81d7150e02472430eab555dfc4f053738bf99bb6&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;81d7150&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bholmesdev&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​bholmesdev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! - Adds support for &lt;code&gt;Date()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Map()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Set()&lt;/code&gt; from action results.

However, there will be upcoming changes where parties can be routed to on the basis of any url (or even any other param, like a session id or whatever). This change lets clients connect with a &lt;code&gt;prefix&lt;/code&gt; param. It also uses /parties/main/:room when connecting to the default party.

This removes those non-fatal errors from being tracked.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;h2&gt;4.11.1&lt;/h2&gt;<br>&lt;h3&gt;Patch Changes&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://redirect.github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11308&quot;&gt;#11308&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/44c61ddfd85f1c23f8cec8caeaa5e25897121996&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;44c61dd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ematipico&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@​ematipico&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!
