This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.<br><br>The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it&#39;s been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.<br><br>## Suggested Solution<br><br>Install and add content to Docusaurus.</td>

However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.<br><br>I attached here the screen recording of local preview.<br><br>**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn&#39;t affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. <br><br>### Steps To Reproduce<br><br>1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.<br>2. Once it&#39;s ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.<br>3. Click the link to any page to open it.<br>4.

For each of those, we need to add `&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;` after the first or second paragraph. You should add it where it makes sense to cut off the text, giving the reader enough information to understand what the blog post is about and interested in reading more. Here&#39;s an example:<br><br><br>&gt; We&#39;ve talked a lot about the challenges of being a maintainer, especially a solo maintainer. But like I say in our recent [newsletter](https://news.opensauced.pizza/why-open-source-is-a-team-sport/), open source is a team sport. But finding the right teammates can be a tricky situation as well. You might not get it right all of the time. And that&#39;s ok. Taking steps to make sure you and your project stay healthy can help to create a smoother and more rewarding open source experience. In this blog post, I&#39;ll provide a checklist and examples to help you build and manage an effective team for your open source project.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; `&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;`<br><br><br><br></td>

The button in the &quot;Becoming a Maintainer&quot; card appears higher than the button in the &quot;Intro to Open Source Course&quot; card due to differences in the content length of the two cards. This creates an inconsistent user experience and disrupts the visual layout of the page.<br>![Before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e34b3f3-f8c5-48da-8963-c257f58e6a12)<br><br><br>### Steps to reproduce<br><br>1. Navigate to the page that displays both the &quot;Intro to Open Source Course&quot; and &quot;Becoming a Maintainer Course&quot; cards.<br>2. Observe that the &quot;Becoming a Maintainer&quot; card has less content compared to the &quot;Intro to Open Source Course&quot; card.<br>3. Notice that the button for &quot;Start the Becoming a Maintainer Course&quot; is positioned higher than the button for &quot;Start the Intro to Open Source Course.&quot;<br>4. The misalignment becomes more evident on varying screen sizes.</td>

      <td>## The best part of Virtual Coffee is our members ‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>In order to showcase our collective awesomeness, let&#39;s put together a members page! <br><br>Members will individually add their GitHub username. At build time, we&#39;ll pull down their GitHub profile and display their info on a page located at /members.<br><br>This is the first iteration of this feature, so we&#39;ll add features to it as we go.<br><br>---<br><br>### Note - only PRs from existing Virtual Coffee members will be accepted<br><br>Attending one of our Virtual Coffee events is the best way to learn how to become a member.<br><br>---<br><br># Adding yourself to the members page:<br><br>## GitHub Profile Information<br><br>Members can edit their GitHub profile at https://github.com/settings/profile<br><br>virtualcoffee.io will only ever have access to the public profile information, never anything private.<br><br>Info we&#39;ll use to build the members page:<br>- Name<br>- Profile Picture<br>- URL<br>- Bio<br>- Twitter Username<br><br>Before you submit a PR, take a moment and check out this information to make sure it&#39;s accurate and you feel comfortable displaying it on our site!<br><br>## How to add or update your profile:<br><br>The steps below involve your GitHub username. For each of the steps below, replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username (mine is `danieltott` for example).<br><br>- Follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to create a fork of this repository and clone it to your local machine.<br>- Create a branch called `members/yourusername`<br>- **If you&#39;re adding your profile for the first time:**<br>  - Create a copy of [`src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts`](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts) and name it `yourusername.ts`<br>  - **NOTE:** for the _file name and export name_, please remove any dashes in your username. You can replace them with underscores or just remove them entirely. For example, if my username was `virtual-coffee`, we&#39;d want to change that to `virtualcoffee.ts` for the file name, and for the export name in the next step.<br>  - Replace `_EXAMPLE` on line 4 with your github username<br>    ```diff<br>    - export const _EXAMPLE: MemberObject = {<br>    + export const yourusername: MemberObject = {<br>    ```<br>  - Update the `github` value to your username, and follow the comments in the file to customize any additional parts of your VC profile<br>  - **Note** - if you already have the local version running, you&#39;ll need to stop the server and restart it to see the new file.<br>  - Commit the new file<br>- **If you&#39;re already on the page but would like to update your profile:**<br>  - Find `src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts`<br>  - Inside you will find the file all set up, follow the comments in the file to update any data you&#39;d like<br>  - Commit the modified file<br>- Push your branch up to your fork<br>- Create a Pull Request and link to this issue<br><br>At this point, the pull request will create a Deploy Preview that you can use to preview your changes.<br><br>If you&#39;d like to try updating the data on your own, here are the steps you can follow, but _it&#39;s not required_.<br><br>- To test locally, follow the [Local Development steps listed in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/README.md#local-development)<br>- After the site is installed, you&#39;ll need to follow [these directions to create a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).<br>  - The token only needs permission for the user =&gt; read:user scope to function for this task:<br>    &lt;img width=&quot;528&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot of scopes form&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131928/113331986-9c795080-92ee-11eb-9e31-67d99eed5ded.png&quot;&gt;<br>- Once you have your token, create a new file called `.env` and copy the contents from `.env.example`. Then, uncomment the `GITHUB_TOKEN` line, and replace `yourtoken` with your token created in the previous step.<br>- Then run `yarn start` to preview your changes!<br>- Again, these steps are not required for the PR to be accepted<br><br>And you&#39;re done!<br><br>Our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) has a lot of information about getting started with GitHub and Pull Requests, so you might want to take a look at that as well if you are new to this process.<br><br>Please feel free to add any questions here in the comments!</td>
