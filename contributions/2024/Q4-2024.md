      <td>## Description

As our docs for monthly challenges is getting longer, it needs to have more structure and follow the best practice of Markdown. Also, they start to throw Markdown warnings on VSCode.

## Suggested Solution

- Fix the Markdown as much as possible to follow the best practice.
- Fix the structure of the whole monthly challenge docs to get it ready for Docusaurus.</td>

### Context for documentation change

Based on the last townhall meeting, there are changes in the maintainers responsibilities. We've announced this on townhall and Slack, but it will be helpful if we add these to our docs.

### Proposed solution

Add maintainers duty and responsibilities to the README. I'm thinking to adjust the structure as below:

```markdown
# Virtual Coffee Community Building Resources
    ## About Virtual Coffee
    ## Maintainers
    ## Team Leads
    ## Quick Links
```

The rest will remain the same.

### Resources that can help

_No response_

### Collaborators

@Virtual-Coffee/maintainers any thoughts on this?

      <td>## Description

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it's been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.

## Suggested Solution

Install and add content to Docusaurus.</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

Chrome

### Environment

```markdown
- OS:
- Node:
- pnpm:
```

## Description

We see some contributors wrote their PR description and/or related issue in the comments, which are hidden in preview mode. This causes maintainers and the bot don't see this info when they review the PR. We need to add information to write PR details outside the comments in the PR template.

Another thing is some contributors use the example issue number in the comment and not their own. We need to clarify this.

## Suggested Solution

Below are the lines that need to be updated and how they need to be updated.

   For example: This PR adds <your-github-username> as a contributor.
