A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

As our docs for monthly challenges is getting longer, it needs to have more structure and follow the best practice of Markdown. Also, they start to throw Markdown warnings on VSCode.

## Suggested Solution

- Fix the Markdown as much as possible to follow the best practice.
- Fix the structure of the whole monthly challenge docs to get it ready for Docusaurus.</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

Based on the last townhall meeting, there are changes in the maintainers responsibilities. We've announced this on townhall and Slack, but it will be helpful if we add these to our docs.

### Proposed solution

Add maintainers duty and responsibilities to the README. I'm thinking to adjust the structure as below:

```markdown
# Virtual Coffee Community Building Resources
    ## About Virtual Coffee
    ## Maintainers
    ## Team Leads
    ## Quick Links
```

The rest will remain the same.

### Resources that can help

_No response_

### Collaborators

@Virtual-Coffee/maintainers any thoughts on this?

      <td>## Description

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it's been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.

## Suggested Solution

Install and add content to Docusaurus.</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

Chrome

### Environment

```markdown
- OS:
- Node:
- pnpm:
```


### Anything else?

&gt; We may remove you from the assignees and not accept your pull request if you choose to proceed.

## Description

We see some contributors wrote their PR description and/or related issue in the comments, which are hidden in preview mode. This causes maintainers and the bot don't see this info when they review the PR. We need to add information to write PR details outside the comments in the PR template.

Another thing is some contributors use the example issue number in the comment and not their own. We need to clarify this.

I would also suggest including in the documentation that while creating a new repository is recommended for open source contributions, forking the repository can remain an option as well. This approach offers flexibility for contributors and encourages collaboration. Also I think the documentation could be left open to contribute for better suggestions.</td>

There is one specifically for community, so we need to write the content and decide if this layout will work for what we want to see on the page.

This page is intended to explain to people how they can engage with the Mautic project and community. It will be a sub-page of the Community page (see #6) so you should align closely with the person working on that task so that there's some continuity between the two.

If you'd like to make a mockup on Figma / Canva / Whatever to show the web team how you'd like this page to look (e.g. if you want to use images, layouts etc), please do (and share it with us in the issue comments).

We need to add this to the following posts:

### Steps to reproduce

1. For each of those, we need to add `&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;` after the first or second paragraph. You should add it where it makes sense to cut off the text, giving the reader enough information to understand what the blog post is about and interested in reading more. Here's an example:


&gt; We've talked a lot about the challenges of being a maintainer, especially a solo maintainer. But like I say in our recent [newsletter](https://news.opensauced.pizza/why-open-source-is-a-team-sport/), open source is a team sport. But finding the right teammates can be a tricky situation as well. You might not get it right all of the time. And that's ok. Taking steps to make sure you and your project stay healthy can help to create a smoother and more rewarding open source experience. In this blog post, I'll provide a checklist and examples to help you build and manage an effective team for your open source project.
&gt;
&gt; `&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;`

      <td>### Describe the bug

The buttons &quot;Start the Intro to Open Source Course&quot; and &quot;Start the Becoming a Maintainer Course&quot; are misaligned in the card components. The button in the &quot;Becoming a Maintainer&quot; card appears higher than the button in the &quot;Intro to Open Source Course&quot; card due to differences in the content length of the two cards. This creates an inconsistent user experience and disrupts the visual layout of the page.
![Before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e34b3f3-f8c5-48da-8963-c257f58e6a12)


### Steps to reproduce

1. Navigate to the page that displays both the &quot;Intro to Open Source Course&quot; and &quot;Becoming a Maintainer Course&quot; cards.
2. Observe that the &quot;Becoming a Maintainer&quot; card has less content compared to the &quot;Intro to Open Source Course&quot; card.
3. Notice that the button for &quot;Start the Becoming a Maintainer Course&quot; is positioned higher than the button for &quot;Start the Intro to Open Source Course.&quot;
4. The misalignment becomes more evident on varying screen sizes.</td>

The `.DS_STORE` files are generated by macOS and are not needed in the repository. 

1. **Delete existing `.DS_STORE` file** 

2. **Add `.DS_STORE` to `.gitignore`:** 
   -  Add the following line to the `.gitignore` file: `*.DS_STORE`
   
This will prevent future `.DS_STORE` files from being added to the repository, keeping it clean and efficient.

      <td>## The best part of Virtual Coffee is our members ❤️

In order to showcase our collective awesomeness, let's put together a members page! 

Members will individually add their GitHub username. At build time, we'll pull down their GitHub profile and display their info on a page located at /members.

This is the first iteration of this feature, so we'll add features to it as we go.

---

### Note - only PRs from existing Virtual Coffee members will be accepted

Attending one of our Virtual Coffee events is the best way to learn how to become a member.

---

# Adding yourself to the members page:

## GitHub Profile Information

Members can edit their GitHub profile at https://github.com/settings/profile

virtualcoffee.io will only ever have access to the public profile information, never anything private.

Info we'll use to build the members page:
- Name
- Profile Picture
- URL
- Bio
- Twitter Username

Before you submit a PR, take a moment and check out this information to make sure it's accurate and you feel comfortable displaying it on our site!

## How to add or update your profile:

The steps below involve your GitHub username. For each of the steps below, replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username (mine is `danieltott` for example).

- Follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to create a fork of this repository and clone it to your local machine.
- Create a branch called `members/yourusername`
- **If you're adding your profile for the first time:**
  - Create a copy of [`src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts`](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts) and name it `yourusername.ts`
  - **NOTE:** for the _file name and export name_, please remove any dashes in your username. You can replace them with underscores or just remove them entirely. For example, if my username was `virtual-coffee`, we'd want to change that to `virtualcoffee.ts` for the file name, and for the export name in the next step.
  - Replace `_EXAMPLE` on line 4 with your github username
    ```diff
    - export const _EXAMPLE: MemberObject = {
    + export const yourusername: MemberObject = {
    ```
  - Update the `github` value to your username, and follow the comments in the file to customize any additional parts of your VC profile
  - **Note** - if you already have the local version running, you'll need to stop the server and restart it to see the new file.
  - Commit the new file
- **If you're already on the page but would like to update your profile:**
  - Find `src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts`
  - Inside you will find the file all set up, follow the comments in the file to update any data you'd like
  - Commit the modified file
- Push your branch up to your fork
- Create a Pull Request and link to this issue

At this point, the pull request will create a Deploy Preview that you can use to preview your changes.

If you'd like to try updating the data on your own, here are the steps you can follow, but _it's not required_.

- To test locally, follow the [Local Development steps listed in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/README.md#local-development)
- After the site is installed, you'll need to follow [these directions to create a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
  - The token only needs permission for the user =&gt; read:user scope to function for this task:
    &lt;img width=&quot;528&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot of scopes form&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131928/113331986-9c795080-92ee-11eb-9e31-67d99eed5ded.png&quot;&gt;
- Once you have your token, create a new file called `.env` and copy the contents from `.env.example`. Then, uncomment the `GITHUB_TOKEN` line, and replace `yourtoken` with your token created in the previous step.
- Then run `yarn start` to preview your changes!
- Again, these steps are not required for the PR to be accepted

And you're done!

Our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) has a lot of information about getting started with GitHub and Pull Requests, so you might want to take a look at that as well if you are new to this process.
