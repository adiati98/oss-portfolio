A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it's been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

Chrome

### Environment

```markdown
- OS:
- Node:
- pnpm:
```

## Description

We see some contributors wrote their PR description and/or related issue in the comments, which are hidden in preview mode. This causes maintainers and the bot don't see this info when they review the PR. We need to add information to write PR details outside the comments in the PR template.

Another thing is some contributors use the example issue number in the comment and not their own. We need to clarify this.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

### Environment

Based on the last townhall meeting, there are changes in the maintainers responsibilities. We've announced this on townhall and Slack, but it will be helpful if we add these to our docs.

### Proposed solution

Add maintainers duty and responsibilities to the README. I'm thinking to adjust the structure as below:

```markdown
# Virtual Coffee Community Building Resources
    ## About Virtual Coffee
    ## Maintainers
    ## Team Leads
    ## Quick Links
```

The rest will remain the same.

      <td>## Description

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it's been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.

## Suggested Solution

Install and add content to Docusaurus.</td>

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

&gt; We may remove you from the assignees and not accept your pull request if you choose to proceed.

## Description

We see some contributors wrote their PR description and/or related issue in the comments, which are hidden in preview mode. This causes maintainers and the bot don't see this info when they review the PR. We need to add information to write PR details outside the comments in the PR template.

Another thing is some contributors use the example issue number in the comment and not their own. We need to clarify this.

      <td>## Description

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over &quot;by hand.&quot;

## Steps to Update

In the code base, navigate to `content &gt; newsletters` and create a new file `2024-10.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in the [&quot;Newsletters&quot; section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

&gt; If you've worked on any issue and/or an issue with `good first issue` label in any of our [community repositories](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/opensauced-maintainers-guide/community-maintainers-guide/#opensauced-community-repositories) before, please refrain from taking this issue.
&gt; We may remove you from the assignees and not accept your pull request if you choose to proceed.

## Description

We see some contributors wrote their PR description and/or related issue in the comments, which are hidden in preview mode. This causes maintainers and the bot don't see this info when they review the PR. We need to add information to write PR details outside the comments in the PR template.

Another thing is some contributors use the example issue number in the comment and not their own. We need to clarify this.

## Suggested Solution

Below are the lines that need to be updated and how they need to be updated.
