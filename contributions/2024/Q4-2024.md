      <td>### Description:<br>This pull request addresses an issue with the `editUrl` configuration in the `docusaurus.config.js` file, where the `editUrl` was incorrectly concatenating the paths for editing the documentation. The issue was observed when the documentation structure was split into multiple subfolders, but the correct path was not reflected in the edit links.<br><br>#### Problem:<br>When attempting to edit documentation from the site, the generated edit URL was appending paths incorrectly. For example, it was redirecting users to:<br>```<br>https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/README.md/docs/intro-to-oss/README.md<br>```<br>This resulted in a broken link because of the duplicate path segments.<br><br>#### Solution:<br>1. **Dynamic Path Handling**: Updated the `editUrl` on line 47 of the `docusaurus.config.js` file to handle the subfolder structure dynamically. The `editUrl` now accurately reflects the path by properly concatenating the correct segments of the URL.<br>   <br>2. **Folder Structure**: The course documentation was split into two subfolders, which wasn&#39;t properly handled in the `editUrl` path. The issue has now been resolved by making the `editUrl` match the actual structure of the docs subfolder.<br><br>### Changes Made:<br>- Modified the `editUrl` on line 47 of the `docusaurus.config.js` to dynamically handle the subfolder structure.<br>- Ensured that the URL correctly redirects to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository for the documentation:<br>   ```<br>   https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/README.md<br>   ```<br><br>### Verification:<br>- Verified that the changes work locally by testing the documentation edit links in the Docusaurus site. The edit links now correctly redirect to the respective documentation files in the GitHub repository.<br>  <br>### Affected Files:<br>- `docusaurus.config.js`: Corrected the `editUrl` configuration to prevent path duplication and broken links.<br><br>### Related Issues:<br>Close #241 <br>---</td>

For each of those, we need to add `&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;` after the first or second paragraph. You should add it where it makes sense to cut off the text, giving the reader enough information to understand what the blog post is about and interested in reading more. Here&#39;s an example:<br><br><br>&gt; We&#39;ve talked a lot about the challenges of being a maintainer, especially a solo maintainer. But like I say in our recent [newsletter](https://news.opensauced.pizza/why-open-source-is-a-team-sport/), open source is a team sport. But finding the right teammates can be a tricky situation as well. You might not get it right all of the time. And that&#39;s ok. Taking steps to make sure you and your project stay healthy can help to create a smoother and more rewarding open source experience. In this blog post, I&#39;ll provide a checklist and examples to help you build and manage an effective team for your open source project.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; `&lt;!-- truncate --&gt;`<br><br><br><br></td>

Notice that the button for &quot;Start the Becoming a Maintainer Course&quot; is positioned higher than the button for &quot;Start the Intro to Open Source Course.&quot;<br>4.

For each of the steps below, replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username (mine is `danieltott` for example).<br><br>- Follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to create a fork of this repository and clone it to your local machine.<br>- Create a branch called `members/yourusername`<br>- **If you&#39;re adding your profile for the first time:**<br>  - Create a copy of [`src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts`](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts) and name it `yourusername.ts`<br>  - **NOTE:** for the _file name and export name_, please remove any dashes in your username. You can replace them with underscores or just remove them entirely. For example, if my username was `virtual-coffee`, we&#39;d want to change that to `virtualcoffee.ts` for the file name, and for the export name in the next step.<br>  - Replace `_EXAMPLE` on line 4 with your github username<br>    ```diff<br>    - export const _EXAMPLE: MemberObject = {<br>    + export const yourusername: MemberObject = {<br>    ```<br>  - Update the `github` value to your username, and follow the comments in the file to customize any additional parts of your VC profile<br>  - **Note** - if you already have the local version running, you&#39;ll need to stop the server and restart it to see the new file.<br>  - Commit the new file<br>- **If you&#39;re already on the page but would like to update your profile:**<br>  - Find `src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts`<br>  - Inside you will find the file all set up, follow the comments in the file to update any data you&#39;d like<br>  - Commit the modified file<br>- Push your branch up to your fork<br>- Create a Pull Request and link to this issue<br><br>At this point, the pull request will create a Deploy Preview that you can use to preview your changes.<br><br>If you&#39;d like to try updating the data on your own, here are the steps you can follow, but _it&#39;s not required_.<br><br>- To test locally, follow the [Local Development steps listed in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/README.md#local-development)<br>- After the site is installed, you&#39;ll need to follow [these directions to create a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).<br>  - The token only needs permission for the user =&gt; read:user scope to function for this task:<br>    &lt;img width=&quot;528&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot of scopes form&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131928/113331986-9c795080-92ee-11eb-9e31-67d99eed5ded.png&quot;&gt;<br>- Once you have your token, create a new file called `.env` and copy the contents from `.env.example`. Then, uncomment the `GITHUB_TOKEN` line, and replace `yourtoken` with your token created in the previous step.<br>- Then run `yarn start` to preview your changes!<br>- Again, these steps are not required for the PR to be accepted<br><br>And you&#39;re done!<br><br>Our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) has a lot of information about getting started with GitHub and Pull Requests, so you might want to take a look at that as well if you are new to this process.<br><br>Please feel free to add any questions here in the comments!</td>
