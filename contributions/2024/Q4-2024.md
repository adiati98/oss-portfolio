A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes were made.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Description

This PR adds the documentation for the &quot;Mid-Year Check-In&quot; challenge.

&lt;!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

As our docs for monthly challenges is getting longer, it needs to have more structure and follow the best practice of Markdown. Also, they start to throw Markdown warnings on VSCode.

      <td>## Description

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it's been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.

## Suggested Solution

Install and add content to Docusaurus.</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

### Environment

&gt; We may remove you from the assignees and not accept your pull request if you choose to proceed.

## Description

We see some contributors wrote their PR description and/or related issue in the comments, which are hidden in preview mode. This causes maintainers and the bot don't see this info when they review the PR. We need to add information to write PR details outside the comments in the PR template.

Another thing is some contributors use the example issue number in the comment and not their own. We need to clarify this.

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

Based on the last townhall meeting, there are changes in the maintainers responsibilities. We've announced this on townhall and Slack, but it will be helpful if we add these to our docs.

### Proposed solution

Add maintainers duty and responsibilities to the README. I'm thinking to adjust the structure as below:

```markdown
# Virtual Coffee Community Building Resources
    ## About Virtual Coffee
    ## Maintainers
    ## Team Leads
    ## Quick Links
```

The rest will remain the same.

      <td>## Description

As per conversation with @BekahHW, it'd be great to have our community docs live in a documentation platform, such as [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This way, our docs can have more structure, and it would be easy to access by members and public. Eventually, we will link this to our website for more expose.

The reason of using Docusaurus is it has regular updates, it's been used by many big projects, and it has a strong community in case we need more information.

## Suggested Solution

Install and add content to Docusaurus.</td>

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

When navigating between pages locally in the resources, they all lead to 404.

This happens because the link should be `http://localhost:9000/resources/{page}`. However, as resources lives in the `content` folder, whenever we navigate to a page, the link will go to `http://localhost:9000/content/resources/{page}`.

I attached here the screen recording of local preview.

**Note:** Please be informed that this only happens for the `resources` folder. It doesn't affect the `members` and `newsletters` folders that also live in the `content` folder. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the project locally with `pnpm dev`.
2. Once it's ready, go to `http://localhost:9000/resources`.
3. Click the link to any page to open it.
4. You will get 404.

### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?

Chrome

### Environment

```markdown
- OS:
- Node:
- pnpm:
```

You will find the wireframes for the new website at https://www.figma.com/design/OIqb9D6IT3mOP2HjqlZ230/Mautic.org-website-wireframe?node-id=71-267&t=wmMT8GYs1z5xCZuH-1 which shows the kinds of blocks (far right) and layouts we have available. There is one specifically for community, so we need to write the content and decide if this layout will work for what we want to see on the page.

This page is intended to explain to people how they can engage with the Mautic project and community. It will be a sub-page of the Community page (see #6) so you should align closely with the person working on that task so that there's some continuity between the two.

If you'd like to make a mockup on Figma / Canva / Whatever to show the web team how you'd like this page to look (e.g. if you want to use images, layouts etc), please do (and share it with us in the issue comments).

Copied below from the Jira issue:

This issue relates to updating the content for Communication channels, which you can find at https://www.mautic.org/community/get-involved/communication-channels. If there are any comments from the team they will be found below.

      <td>## Description

As this repository is completely to add contributors to the guestbook with minimum information and we're moving translations at the Open Sauced Education Path to be Community Translations, we don't need to translate anything here. Therefore, the translation guidelines is not necessary.

## Suggested Solution

- Remove the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Remove the &quot;Translations&quot; list from the [Contributing](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributing) section on the README.</td>

      <td>## Description

As part of Intro to OSS course, the contributing guidelines in this guestbook repo is following and being adjusted from the guidelines at the intro repository. But as the intro repository evolves, the contributing guidelines in this repo is no longer 100% accurate. Therefore, it needs to be updated.

Another reason is as Hacktoberfest is approaching, we want to make this repo ready for contributions not only from the course participants, but also from folks who don't take our Intro to OSS course.

## Suggested Solution

### Alternative 1

Update the contributing guidelines by adding instructions from [Let's Get Practical](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section and adjust other sections accordingly.

### Alternative 2

Remove the contributing guidelines completely with below reasons:

- We have the [Getting Started](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section on the README that navigate folks to the instructions of adding themselves to the guestbook.
- The [Contributing](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributing) section on the README already holds the information for folks to improve our Intro to OSS course. </td>

      <td>## Motivation

As our monthly challenges are evolving, we need to update our documentation for the Monthly Challenge Team to accomodate the changes. It will be very helpful for new volunteers to onboard themselves when we have updated documentation.

## Suggestions

Let's gradually improving the docs for Monthly Challenge Team as we go and when we know the structure for every challenge.

We can update the docs we have now (and rename the files accordingly). Or we can create a new file for each challenge, and archive the old one in a folder once the challenge is updated.

## To Do

### General Docs

- [x] Create how to update monthly challenge page on the website docs.
- [x] Update `leader-docs.md`.

### Update VC Challenges (in no particular order)

- [x] Hacktoberfest
- [x] Month of Learning
- [x] Get Job Ready
- [x] Creative Community Challenge
- [x] Blogging Challenge
- [x] Preptember
- [x] Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
- [x] Build in Public
- [x] Community Kindness
- [x] Creating Audio/Visual content
- [x] Pairing
- [x] Month of Feedback
- [x] Mid-Year Check-In
- [x] New Year, New Goals (NEW!)

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>
