For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Description<br><br>This PR adds March 2024 challenge (Get Job Ready) to the website with changes as follow:<br><br>1. In the `app/routes/__frontend/monthlychallenges/index.tsx`:<br>   - [x] Set `current: true` to the &quot;Get Job Ready&quot; challenge and remove it from &quot;Month of Learning Challenge&quot; challenge. <br>   - [x] Add completed challenge alert to February challenge.<br><br> 2.  In the `app\routes\__frontend\monthlychallenges`:<br>     - [x] Create `mar-2024.jsx` file.<br>     - [x] Use the content of last year&#39;s Get Job Ready challenge and adjust it based on the needs of current challenge.<br><br>### Live Preview<br><br>**Monthly challenge page**<br><br><br><br>**March challenge page**<br><br><br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.<br><br>It explains what you&#39;ve done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.<br><br>A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.<br><br>If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.<br><br>@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Methodology<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>This section explains why the above changes explained were done.<br><br>Sometimes a developer feels that it&#39;s okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That&#39;s fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.<br><br>If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it&#39;s always good to attach a document reference link for that information.<br><br>A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Code of Conduct<br><br>&gt; By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)<br></td>

For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Description<br><br>This PR adds February 2024 newsletter to the website and updates the `newsletters.ts`.<br><br>### Live Preview<br><br>https://deploy-preview-1128--virtual-coffee-io.netlify.app/newsletter/issues/2024-02<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.<br><br>It explains what you&#39;ve done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.<br><br>A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.<br><br>If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.<br><br>@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Methodology<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>This section explains why the above changes explained were done.<br><br>Sometimes a developer feels that it&#39;s okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That&#39;s fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.<br><br>If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it&#39;s always good to attach a document reference link for that information.<br><br>A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Code of Conduct<br><br>&gt; By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)<br></td>

You get the gist.<br><br>A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.<br><br>If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.<br><br>@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Methodology<br><br>&lt;!--<br><br>This section explains why the above changes explained were done.<br><br>Sometimes a developer feels that it&#39;s okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That&#39;s fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.<br><br>If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it&#39;s always good to attach a document reference link for that information.<br><br>A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.<br><br>--&gt;<br><br>## Code of Conduct<br><br>&gt; By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)<br></td>

However, we don&#39;t have this stated anywhere in our contributing guide.<br><br>2. **Admonitions**<br><br>   Docusaurus supports special [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) syntax to highlight note, tip, info, etc. There are some notes and tips that we can highlight in this page.<br><br>### Suggested solution<br><br>1.

      <td>### Describe the bug<br><br>### Background<br><br>As we&#39;re moving to workspace and have path changes, I want to check if the old links to insights are afftected with this changes. Good news is I still can access them. But I found something new instead.<br><br>### The Bug<br><br>- Logged out user can open the sidebar and see the list of repo and contributor insights, even the private ones.<br>- When logged out user click &quot;show all&quot; at Repository Insights on the sidebar, it will redirect them to the Repository Insights page, but no page is shown.<br>- When logged out user click &quot;show all&quot; at Contributor Insights on the sidebar, it will redirect them to the Contributor Insights page, and all public and private pages are shown.<br>- Logged out user is able to click the &quot;bin&quot; icon. They will be prompted with a message to type the name of the page. They can click the &quot;Delete&quot; button, however it won&#39;t delete the page as they&#39;re not signing in.<br>- Logged out user is able to click the create new repo or contributor insights page and fill the data. But they are unable to create a new page. The warning of &quot;You must be logged in to create a page&quot; appears.<br><br>### Expected Behaviour <br><br>When a logged out user open the shared link, they shouldn&#39;t be able to see the insights pages, especially the private ones, even on the sidebar.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if there is an intention for someone who doesn&#39;t have account on OpenSauced to have a taste of creating a new page. However, they shouldn&#39;t be able to see the list of insights pages.<br><br>Ideally, the sidebar can&#39;t be seen on shared pages.<br><br>### Screen Recording<br><br>&lt;br&gt;<br><br>![insights pages on sidebar](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/134825e9-1a4b-42a6-8f4f-9efa54885abd)<br><br><br>### Screenshots<br><br>&lt;br&gt;<br><br>![Screenshot 2024-03-01 142230](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/a0f72479-c4b0-46a1-bc61-525d40f35738)<br><br>![Screenshot 2024-03-01 142439](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/32f8b090-7182-405f-836a-e958416b5ffd)<br><br><br>![Screenshot 2024-03-01 142103](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/8b1ccdc2-06f8-4637-8d29-06766646a392)<br><br><br><br>![Screenshot 2024-03-01 130240](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/5512ae9d-f38d-45c0-87ae-c916a274b1e0)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>### Steps to reproduce<br><br>In the state of logged out:<br><br>1. Go to a public shared insight page. You can use this link: https://app.opensauced.pizza/pages/BekahHW/1055/dashboard that shared by @BekahHW on docs.<br>   It will redirect you to the new path of workspace.<br>3. Click the sidebar.<br>4. You will see the list of the user&#39;s insights page.<br>5. Click &quot;show all&quot; for the Contributor Insights.<br>6. You will see the list of public and private pages.<br>7. You can click each of the page to open it and see the insights.<br>8. You can even click the &quot;bin&quot; icon. It will give you the prompt to type the name of the page to delete the page. However, clicking it won&#39;t delete the page as you&#39;re logged out. (I don&#39;t want to try this when I&#39;m signing in, so I don&#39;t know how it behaves if the user is signing in).<br>9. Open the sidebar. <br>10. Click the &quot;+&quot; and select create repo or contributor insights page.<br>11. Fill in the areas.<br>12. Click the &quot;Create page&quot; button.<br>13.

      <td>### Describe the bug<br><br>Currently, we have this in the &quot;Code Owners&quot; subsection of the Maintainer Power-Ups chapter.<br><br>1. &gt; - **Prevent contributors from manually adding reviewers**<br>   &gt;<br>   &gt;    When a PR comes from external contributors, they cannot add reviewers manually. That way, they don&#39;t have to comment on the PR, and it also helps you by preventing them from adding non-maintainers — such as regular contributors — as reviewers.<br><br>   This paragraph sounds quite confusing and hard to follow.<br><br>2. &gt; - **Branch protection**<br>   &gt;<br>   &gt;   If you opt-in to &quot;Require approval&quot; and &quot;Require review from Code Owners&quot; to protect a branch, a certain number of code owners must approve any pull request before the pull request can be merged into the protected branch.<br><br>   We can add a little bit reason why maintainers want to protect a branch.<br><br>3. Intro paragraph can be adjusted for clarity.<br>4. We want to have consistency with the word _pull request_.<br><br>### Suggestion<br><br>1. Change all &quot;PR&quot; word to &quot;pull request&quot; in the file.<br>2. Fix the wording with something as follow:<br><br>   &gt; - **Prevent contributors from manually adding reviewers**<br>   &gt;<br>   &gt;    When a pull request comes from external contributors, _code owners prevents them from manually adding reviewers because it automatically adds the reviewers. That way, contributors don&#39;t have to comment and tag anyone on the comment to review their pull request. It also helps you to stop them from adding non-maintainers — such as regular contributors — as reviewers._<br><br>   &gt; - **Branch protection**<br>   &gt;<br>   &gt;   If you opt-in to &quot;Require approval&quot; and &quot;Require review from Code Owners&quot; to protect a branch, a certain number of code owners must approve any pull request before it can be merged into the protected branch. _This can reduce the chance of merging pull requests that can break the production_.<br><br>3. Adjust the intro with something like:<br><br>   &gt; Most of the time, contributors don&#39;t know the maintainers of a project, so they don&#39;t know who to add as reviewers. When they create a PR, _they usually leave a comment without tagging anyone, like, &quot;Can you please review my PR?&quot; Without being tagged,_ maintainers don&#39;t get notified about this new PR and comment, causing it to be missed from the radar. Adding the CODEOWNERS file to the repository will help you to automate and tackle this issue.<br><br>### Steps to reproduce<br><br>1.

Contributors using the CLI Tool method to submit their profile. <br>2. Contributors are not running `npm run contributors:add`and `npm run contributors:generate`commands to generate their profile in the guestbook.<br><br>After discussing this with @adiati98 and @BekahHW, we&#39;ve come to the realization that giving contributors the option to either use the CLI tool or doing it manual is causing this confusion.  <br><br>We also noticed that people are not contributing to the pizza-verse repo in spite of our promotion efforts, making it difficult for us to achieve OpenSauced&#39;s goal to create a contribution pathway for people to grow in their open source journey. <br><br>### Suggested solution<br>For the first part of the issue, we having the following solution:<br><br>- [ ] Go the [&quot;Manual Selection&quot; section in step 5](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md).<br>- [ ] Delete the directions:<br><br> https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/4577a767191b640d3092b61a2c687c864fe96356/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md?plain=1#L162-L211<br><br>- [ ] Go to step 6:<br>https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/4577a767191b640d3092b61a2c687c864fe96356/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md?plain=1#L147<br>- [ ] Replace it with the following statement: <br>`6. Add yourself to the guestbook with the CLI tool`<br><br>- [ ] Go to the next paragraph and delete it: <br>https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/4577a767191b640d3092b61a2c687c864fe96356/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md?plain=1#L149-L156<br><br><br>For the second half of the issue, do the following to add a section about our [pizza-verse repo](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/README.md) in the [Let&#39;s Practical Section](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md):<br>- [ ]  Go this line: https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/4577a767191b640d3092b61a2c687c864fe96356/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md?plain=1#L245<br>- [ ] Add the following statement next to it:<br>`If you&#39;re ready for your next contribution, head on over to the [pizza-verse repo](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse) and follow the contribution guidelines for your next contribution.

      <td>### Type of feature<br><br>🍕 Feature<br><br>### Current behavior<br><br>Although it&#39;s not possible for OpenSauced to create and maintain all requested translations, we value community translation contributions.<br><br>To recognize these contributions but also let our users know that we are not specifically maintaining them, we are creating a file for contributors to link to their translations.<br><br>To do this, there are two steps:<br>1. Create `community-translations.md` at the root of the repo. In that file, Create the following:<br>```<br># Community Course Translations<br>We are grateful for the contributions of the community in translating this course. Although the OpenSauced team does not currently maintain these projects, we want to share the forked copy of the repositories with those taking the course. Below, you will find the latest community translations.<br>```<br>3. In the README in &quot;Additional Information&quot; section, add a bullet point that links to `community-translations.md`, next to the link, it should say that these translations are not maintained by OpenSauced, but we welcome contributors to link their forked translations.<br><br><br>### Suggested solution<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Additional context<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [X] I agree to follow this project&#39;s Code of Conduct<br><br>### Contributing Docs<br><br>- [X] I agree to follow this project&#39;s Contribution Docs</td>

      <td>Currently Tailwind requires us to add dark mode colors within the component. I think that makes it too unreadable and just a pain to maintain.<br><br>The way I set up the colors is:<br><br>```js<br>colors: {<br>  light: {<br>    &quot;slate&quot;: {<br>      &quot;1&quot;: &quot;hsl(206, 30.0%, 98.8%)&quot;,<br>      ...<br>      &quot;12&quot;: &quot;hsl(206, 24.0%, 9.0%)&quot;<br>    },<br>    &quot;slate-a&quot;: {<br>      &quot;1&quot;: &quot;hsla(210, 92.6%, 26.5%, 0.016)&quot;,<br>      ...<br>      &quot;12&quot;: &quot;hsla(202, 97.0%, 2.4%, 0.934)&quot;<br>    }<br>  },<br>  dark: {<br>    &quot;slate&quot;: {<br>      &quot;1&quot;: &quot;hsl(200, 7.0%, 8.8%)&quot;,<br>      ...<br>      &quot;12&quot;: &quot;hsl(210, 6.0%, 93.0%)&quot;<br>    }<br>  }<br>}<br>```<br><br>There should be a way for us to use these color steps as CSS Variables, so when the theme changes, only the values in the CSS Variable change, not the classes in the components.<br><br>You only declare `slate-1` once in the component, then the theme handles whether the color will be from the light or dark theme. <br><br>I&#39;m opening a new issue, because this is not something we need to resolve in this PR, nor is it something urgent.<br><br>_Originally posted by @pixelsbyeryc in https://github.com/open-sauced/insights/issues/55#issuecomment-1182607242_</td>
