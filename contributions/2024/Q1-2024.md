      <td>### Type of feature

üìù Documentation

### Current behavior

There are a couple of things that we need to update in the [contributing guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/):

1. **Create New Branch: Compliance**

   We have a [compliance action](https://github.com/open-sauced/hot/blob/beta/.github/workflows/compliance.yml#L47) that runs to check protected branch. If changes are made directly on default branch, it will give below message:

   ```yml
   ## Protected Branch

   In order to be considered for merging, the pull request changes must
   not be implemented on the "%branch%" branch. This is described in our
   [Contributing Guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/).
   We would suggest that you close this PR and implement your changes as
   described in our Contributing Guide and open a new pull request.
   ```

   Contributors are suggested to close the PR and create a new branch _as described in the contributing guide_. However, we don't have this stated anywhere in our contributing guide.

2. **Admonitions**

   Docusaurus supports special [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) syntax to highlight note, tip, info, etc. There are some notes and tips that we can highlight in this page.

### Suggested solution

1. Update the instructions in [Pull Requests](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/#pull-requests-pr) section by emphasizing the importance of creating new branch and that PRs that has been made directly on default branch will be closed.
2. Add special Docusaurus special admonitions syntax for notes and tips accross the page.

      <td>### Type of feature

üìù Documentation

### Current behavior

We've noticed that some contributors made their changes directly on the `main` branch.

### Suggested solution

We want to make clear that changes are made on new branch and not directly on the `main` branch. 

- [ ] Add step 4 in the "[Setup the Project Locally](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#setup-the-project-locally)" section in the CONTRIBUTING file with copy as follow:

   ````markdown
   4. Create a new branch to work on your changes.

      ```bash
      git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
      ```

      Replace "YOUR-BRANCH-NAME" with a descriptive name for your branch ‚Äî for example, `feat/add-submit-button`.
   ````

- [ ] Change number 4 to 5.

      <td>### Type of feature

üçï Feature

### Current behavior

We don't have an image to show what kind of screeshot that we expect from contributors.
There are cases where contributors submitted the screenshot of their terminal when running command to add themselves as a contributor. 

### Suggested solution

1. Save below image in your local.

    ![profile-generated-readme](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/assets/45172775/59563b61-5fa9-4ae6-af4d-9a0cbd33e410)

2. Add the image to `images` folder with the name `profile-generated.png`.
3. Add the image between point 8 and the alert that starts with `!>` in the "[Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md#getting-started)" section.
   Give an alt-text of "Profile generated on README".
4. Update the wording in point 8 as follow:

   ```markdown
   8. Copy and paste the Markdown of the README in [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) and take a screenshot of your profile being generated as the example below. You will need this later when creating a pull request.
   ```

## Description

We added a step to create an issue when contributing to the guestbook repo to encourage participants in creating an issue as part of open source working flow. But this step is often missed. One of the reasons probably because this step is not detail enough for beginners.

## Suggested Solutions

Let's update the wording to create issue as below copy:

```markdown
1. Create an issue by clicking the "Issues" tab on the top bar and then the green "New issue" button. Click the "Get started" button to add contributors, complete the form, and click the "Submit new issue" button.
```

Code to be changed:

      <td>## Description

There are incorrect links in the README. Also, we want to have consistency with the term "guestbook".

## Suggested Solution

- [ ] Change all "guest book" term to "guestbook" on the README. If it starts with capital letter, keep the capital letter.
- [ ] Update links and some wording in the code snippet with the suggestion following the snippet:

   - [ ] https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook/blob/a425e260c10fbf902db78a497e9b1bff3cdc0990/README.md?plain=1#L12

      <td>### Describe the bug

We have an issue template special to add contributors to guestbook repo. But this template is not listed when we click "New issue" button.

The problem is the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder is located inside the `.github/workflows` and not on the root of `.github` folder.

We also want to rename the issue template to be `add_contributor.yml` to distinguish it from `feature_request.yml` template. 

### Suggested Solution

- Move the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` to the root of `.github` folder.
- Rename issue template file to `add_contributor.yml`.
- Update name in the template to reflect the change.
 

### Steps to reproduce

1. Click the "Issues" tab.
2. Click "New issue" button.
3. You won't find the issue template to add contributors.

### Do you have any images or screen captures?

## Description

We have updated the "[Getting Started](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=getting-started)" section on our Intro to Open Source course as following:

- Adding contributors to the guestbook with CLI only.
- Encouraging contributors to learn how to create issues.

Therefore, we need to update the PR template to reflect this update.

Additionally, we also want to remind contributors to complete the PR form.

## Suggested Solution

- [ ] Add a comment on the first line with the copy below.

   ```markdown
   <!-- Please fill in all areas in this PR form. Incomplete PRs will be marked invalid and may be closed. -->
   ```

- [ ] Add a new section for related issues right after "What type of PR" section. Use the copy below.

```markdown
## Related Issues

<!--

-->
```

      <td>## Description

The English version of our Intro to Open Source course has gone through some updates. But there is no update yet on the French translation for some time.

## Suggested Solution

Update the course's French translation to be synced with the English version. You need to check each page and chapter to update the translation.

Make sure that everything is the same with the English version (headings, spacings, indentations, etc.).

üåü Hi there! We're excited to hear your suggestions and ideas for making this project better. Thank you for contributing to our community!

## Description

We want to make sure that contributors fill in all areas in our PR template.

<!-- Describe your suggestion or improvement in a few sentences. What would you like to see added, changed, or enhanced? -->

## Motivation

Having enough information in the PR form will improve maintainers productivity in reviewing PRs because they don't have to go back and forth to ask for missing information.

<!-- Help us understand why you think this suggestion is valuable. How would it benefit the project or community? -->

## Implementation (if applicable)

Update the PR template with following:

- Notes (more like warning) to complete the PR form. We can say that we might close the PR when the form is incomplete.
- Add a section to include steps to test/QA the changes. Sometimes, we need to run `npm install` to test changes locally or do some steps that we are not aware of. Having this information will make review process more smooth.

<!-- If you have specific ideas on how this suggestion could be implemented, share them here. Code snippets, screenshots, or any additional context are welcome! -->

### Current behavior

Recently, there was an update to the `bug_report.yml` which caused an error and the absence of bug issue template as shown in the screenshots below.

**Note**: I'm using the feature issue template to submit this bug.

### Suggested solution

This bug is most likely caused by [incorrect indentantion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54966747). Fixing the indentation may resolve this.

<!--  üåü Hi there! We're excited to hear your suggestions and ideas for making this project better. Thank you for contributing to our community! -->

## Description

Update feature and bug issue templates.

<!-- Describe your suggestion or improvement in a few sentences. What would you like to see added, changed, or enhanced? -->

## Motivation

- Currently, the "Description" and "Motivation" sections in the Feature issue template are overlap. We can opt one instead of both to avoid confussion.
- Having clearer instructions in the comment and make some sections required to fill in can help contributors fill in all areas necessary and writing clearer issues that benefits maintainers in triaging them.

<!-- Help us understand why you think this suggestion is valuable. How would it benefit the project or community? -->

## Implementation (if applicable)

- Remove the "Motivation" section from "Feature" issue template.
- Update instructions in the comment and comment out some wording that unnecessary to show for better read in both issue templates.
- Add a checklist to abide to our Code of Conduct.

- Make the resource in the quote on the first section in the flow instead of an orphan.
- Remove the concrete PR examples as the bullet points are holding enough details.
- Adjust wording whenever necessary.</td>

      <td>### Describe the bug

When we create a new workspace, after clicking the "Create workspace" button, it will take us to the workspace page.

I was expecting the same thing when we update our workspace. I don't know if this behavior is intentional, but hitting the "Update Workspace" button doesn't take us to the workspace page. Although, there is a notification that says "Workspace updated successfully".

This also happens when adding repositories in "Your workspace", that it's not redirect us to the page. But I think it's also because once we click "Add repositories" button, we get redirected to the edit page.

We have to go to the sidebar and click "Home" to navigate to the workspace page.

I opened a workspace before sigining in. Afterwards, I signed in to my account and saw that my personal workspace is not there anymore. It replaced with the workspace that I opened when I was logged out.

Signing out and signing back in to the app didn't change anything. The workspace is still not mine.

What worked was to clear all the data and cache, and signing back in.

      <td>### Describe the bug

### Background

As we're moving to workspace and have path changes, I want to check if the old links to insights are afftected with this changes. Good news is I still can access them. But I found something new instead.

### The Bug

- Logged out user can open the sidebar and see the list of repo and contributor insights, even the private ones.
- When logged out user click "show all" at Repository Insights on the sidebar, it will redirect them to the Repository Insights page, but no page is shown.
- When logged out user click "show all" at Contributor Insights on the sidebar, it will redirect them to the Contributor Insights page, and all public and private pages are shown.
- Logged out user is able to click the "bin" icon. They will be prompted with a message to type the name of the page. They can click the "Delete" button, however it won't delete the page as they're not signing in.
- Logged out user is able to click the create new repo or contributor insights page and fill the data. But they are unable to create a new page. The warning of "You must be logged in to create a page" appears.

### Expected Behaviour 

When a logged out user open the shared link, they shouldn't be able to see the insights pages, especially the private ones, even on the sidebar.

I'm not sure if there is an intention for someone who doesn't have account on OpenSauced to have a taste of creating a new page. However, they shouldn't be able to see the list of insights pages.

Ideally, the sidebar can't be seen on shared pages.

### Steps to reproduce

In the state of logged out:

1. Go to a public shared insight page. You can use this link: https://app.opensauced.pizza/pages/BekahHW/1055/dashboard that shared by @BekahHW on docs.
   It will redirect you to the new path of workspace.
3. Click the sidebar.
4. You will see the list of the user's insights page.
5. Click "show all" for the Contributor Insights.
6. You will see the list of public and private pages.
7. You can click each of the page to open it and see the insights.
8. You can even click the "bin" icon. It will give you the prompt to type the name of the page to delete the page. However, clicking it won't delete the page as you're logged out. (I don't want to try this when I'm signing in, so I don't know how it behaves if the user is signing in).
9. Open the sidebar. 
10. Click the "+" and select create repo or contributor insights page.
11. Fill in the areas.
12. Click the "Create page" button.
13. The button will load, and a warning of "You must be logged in to create a page" will appear on top for a few seconds.

- In the state of no keyboard, the left side of the button is slightly on top of "Upgrade Workspace" button when scrolling.

When I opened one of the page in the Contributor Insights, the banner of "Upgrade to a PRO Workspace" is displayed on the top. I notice, this bug is only affected the page that's been created by adding contributors manually through "Explore Contributor". 

**Additional info**:

- Another pages that have been created through "sync your GitHub team" and "importing GitHub following" are not affected.
- Repository Insights Pages are not affected.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Issue Context

Currently, active volunteers have badge of their roles on the member page. However, having a section dedicated for them on the member page would be great for these reasons:

- A gesture of appreciation to their valuable support
- Other VC members can easily identify active volunteers
- It would be easier to include the link to this section on resume or social media for active volunteer who are looking for jobs or looking for other opportunities.

### Proposed solution

- Create an "Active Volunteers" section right under "Core Team".
- Move active volunteers to this section.
- Provide clickable link to each sections (Core Team, Active Volunteers, and Our Members).

üçï Feature

### Current behavior

We have an action that informs contributors when they are not assigned to the related issue of the PR. And this worth to add in the [Pull Requests (PR)](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/#pull-requests-pr) section of our contributing guidelines for clarity.

Another thing, the `[!IMPORTANT]` in the section is not supported in docsify [as in GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925). So, we want to change this to bold instead.

### Suggested solution

In the [`docs/contributing/introduction-to-contributing.md`](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs/blob/main/docs/contributing/introduction-to-contributing.md):
1. Go to the "Pull Requests (PRs)" section
2. Fix things in the checklists below:

### Part 1

- [ ] Remove the first paragraph and replace with:

   ```markdown
   ---

   We actively welcome your pull requests. However, you must ensure that **you are assigned** to an existing issue before working on changes, and you need to **link your work to the issue** in your PR form.

   ---
   ```

   Line of code that needs to be changed:

   https://github.com/open-sauced/docs/blob/83e4fbc2e0d89da6805978f54a46826260913f57/docs/contributing/introduction-to-contributing.md?plain=1#L55

### Part 2

- [ ] In the second bullet point of point no. 9, remove the `<br />` and the following sentence.

   ```diff
   - - Unsolicited code is welcomed, but an issue is required to announce your intentions. <br /> **_PRs without a linked issue will be marked invalid and closed_**.
   + - Unsolicited code is welcomed, but an issue is required to announce your intentions.
   ```

    Line of code that needs to be changed:

   https://github.com/open-sauced/docs/blob/83e4fbc2e0d89da6805978f54a46826260913f57/docs/contributing/introduction-to-contributing.md?plain=1#L69

- [ ] After point no. 9, before `[!IMPORTANT]`, add this copy:

   ```markdown
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **PRs will be marked as invalid and may be closed if:**

   - the issue is not assigned to the contributor who opened the PR
   - no issue is linked to the PR
   ```

### Part 3

- [ ] Change the format of the word "IMPORTANT" as below:

   ```diff
   - > [!IMPORTANT]
   + > **IMPORTANT:**
   ```

   Line of code that needs to be changed:

   https://github.com/open-sauced/docs/blob/83e4fbc2e0d89da6805978f54a46826260913f57/docs/contributing/introduction-to-contributing.md?plain=1#L71

### Note

- Check the checklist as you work on your fix.
- Mention all the changes you made based on these checklists in your PR.

      <td>### Describe the bug

Currently, we have these in the "Intro" section:

- The intro sentence is: "Welcome to the "Getting Started with Open Source" course!"
   But our course's name is "Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced". 
- A section with the title "LFG".
   This title is non-inclusive, as non-native English speakers might not know what it stands for without googling.

So, we need to change these.

### Suggested Solutions

- [ ] Change the intro sentence.
  
   ```diff
   - Welcome to the "Getting Started with Open Source" course!
   + Welcome to the "Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced" course!
   ```

   **Code snippet:**

- [ ] Change the title "LFG üöÄ " to "Let's Get Started üöÄ "

   ```diff
   - ## LFG üöÄ
   + ## Let's Get Started üöÄ

   https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/59b55ca73787bbadda275d8b4caabd5e7be0595b/01-intro.md?plain=1#L53

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open the [`01-intro.md`](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/59b55ca73787bbadda275d8b4caabd5e7be0595b/01-intro.md).
2. See the intro sentence and the title of the last section.

üçï Feature

## Current behavior

Although it's not possible for OpenSauced to create and maintain all requested translations, we value community translation contributions.

To recognize these contributions and let our users know that we are not specifically maintaining them, we want to create a space for those willing to maintain translations in any language outside OpenSauced official translations to link to their translations.

_original issue by @BekahHW: https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/issues/71#issue-1935780130_

## Suggested solution

### Create New File

- [ ] Create `community-translations.md` at the root of the repo. In that file, create the following:

   ```markdown
   # Community Course Translations

   We are grateful for the contributions of the community in translating this course. Although the OpenSauced team does not currently maintain these projects, we want to share the forked copy of the repositories with those taking the course. Below, you will find the latest community translations.
   ```

### Adjustment

With a new file added, some content need to be adjusted in two files:

#### 1. README

- [ ] Adjust the "Language Support" section in the README as follow:

   ```markdown
   ## Language Support

   Like pizza, open source is meant to be shared with everyone. We provide and maintain translations in languages below as our official translations:

   - [French](./translations/fr/README.md)

   For translations in other languages that are maintained by our community, please go to the [Community Translations](link to community-translations.md) section.
   ```

   **Code snippet:**
   https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/59b55ca73787bbadda275d8b4caabd5e7be0595b/README.md?plain=1#L11-L16

#### 2. `i18n-guidelines.md`

- [ ] Change the word "OSS" to "Open Source".
- [ ] Add the link to the Community Translation section.

```diff
- We can't always support the maintenance of translations. However, we know some contributors are willing to translate, and we value these contributions. For that reason, we have a Community Translations section.
-
- If you're interested in translating our Intro to OSS course, fork this repository and add the translation to your forked repository. Then, you can add a link to your translation in the `community-translations.md` file.

      <td>## Describe the bug

Currently, we have CODEOWNERS file that contains the list of maintainers. But we don't get added automatically as reviewers as it suppposed to.

On [GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#about-code-owners), it's also mentioned that if a file has a code owner, you can see who the code owner on the file. See example below:

### Suggested Solution

Looking at [the example on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file), there is an asterisk added before team or username.

```text
# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @global-owner1 @global-owner2
```

Let's add this asterisk before all maintainers' name in the CODEOWNERS file.

- [ ] Create a subfolder called `opensauced-maintainers-guide`.
- [ ] Create a `community-maintainers-guide.md` and add the guidelines content here.

Currently, we have this in the "Code Owners" subsection of the Maintainer Power-Ups chapter.

1. > - **Prevent contributors from manually adding reviewers**
   >
   >    When a PR comes from external contributors, they cannot add reviewers manually. That way, they don't have to comment on the PR, and it also helps you by preventing them from adding non-maintainers ‚Äî such as regular contributors ‚Äî as reviewers.

   This paragraph sounds quite confusing and hard to follow.

2. > - **Branch protection**
   >
   >   If you opt-in to "Require approval" and "Require review from Code Owners" to protect a branch, a certain number of code owners must approve any pull request before the pull request can be merged into the protected branch.

   We can add a little bit reason why maintainers want to protect a branch.

3. Intro paragraph can be adjusted for clarity.
4. We want to have consistency with the word _pull request_.

### Suggestion

1. Change all "PR" word to "pull request" in the file.
2. Fix the wording with something as follow:

   > - **Prevent contributors from manually adding reviewers**
   >
   >    When a pull request comes from external contributors, _code owners prevents them from manually adding reviewers because it automatically adds the reviewers. That way, contributors don't have to comment and tag anyone on the comment to review their pull request. It also helps you to stop them from adding non-maintainers ‚Äî such as regular contributors ‚Äî as reviewers._

   > - **Branch protection**
   >
   >   If you opt-in to "Require approval" and "Require review from Code Owners" to protect a branch, a certain number of code owners must approve any pull request before it can be merged into the protected branch. _This can reduce the chance of merging pull requests that can break the production_.

3. Adjust the intro with something like:

   > Most of the time, contributors don't know the maintainers of a project, so they don't know who to add as reviewers. When they create a PR, _they usually leave a comment without tagging anyone, like, "Can you please review my PR?" Without being tagged,_ maintainers don't get notified about this new PR and comment, causing it to be missed from the radar. Adding the CODEOWNERS file to the repository will help you to automate and tackle this issue.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the [Code Owners](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/maintainer-powerups.md#code-owners) subsection.

      <td>### Describe the bug

Currently, there is no consistency when using some of GitHub-related terms, such as README and Contributing Guidelines.

### Suggested Solution

Create consistency by following GitHub's convention for README and CONTRIBUTING as follow:

**README**

- Use **README** to refer the README in general.
- Use **README file** to refer the `README.md` file.
   https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes

**CONTRIBUTING**

- Use **contributing / contribution guidelines** (all lower case) to refer the guidelines in general.
- Use **CONTRIBUTING file** when referring to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
   https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors

**GitHub Actions**

- Use **GitHub Actions** when refering to GitHub Actions.
- Use **action(s)** (lower case) when referring to general actions.
   https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#actions

**YAML**

- Use **YAML** when referring to the language and the file.
   https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms


**Note**: This will be an open issue, be fixed gradually, and be closed when all chapters are checked.

1. Open the repo.
2. Search for "open-source" in each chapter file.
3. You will find this term in most of the chapters.

      <td>## Description

When I created an issue, I don't see a section to link the issue that related to the PR. I added it manually in the PR.

Linking a PR to an issue will give below benefits:

- **Clean organization**: It's easier for maintainers to track the progress and history of the project because every PR is linked to an issue.
- **Automation**: Maintainers don't have to close issues manually after they close PRs. This will save them time and increase productivity.

Here is a resource about [linking a PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

## Suggested solution

In the PR template:

- Add a section ‚Äî you can call it "Related Issues" or anything you want ‚Äî to link the related issue.
- In the section, add a comment out instructions to link the issue. Something like:

  > Add the prefix "Closes", "Fixes", or "Resolves" followed by the related issue number. For example, "Closes #123"</td>

There is a section called [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/petermsouzajr/cy-shadow-report/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct) in the Contributing Guide.

However, there is no docs about Code of Conduct (COC) is attached anywhere in the project.

A COC is very important to have in an open source project to create and ensure a safe and welcoming community around the project and as the base of steps that maintainers will do if someone is not following it.

## Suggested solution

- If you have a COC, create a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the root of your project and add your COC in it. Then link it to your README and Contributing Guide.

**But**

- If you don't have one, you can [add it using a template right on your GitHub as this instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project#adding-a-code-of-conduct-using-a-template) and link it to your README and Contributing Guide.

- [x] Add a step to make a screenshot right after the step to "Run `npm run contributors:generate` in your terminal to generate the guest book on the README.".

> X. Copy and paste the Markdown of the README in [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) and take a screenshot of your profile being generated. You will need this later when creating a pull request. **Tips**: If you don't see your profile in the "Contributors" section, zoom out the screen until you can see it before taking a screenshot.
  
- [x] Fix the numbering of the steps accordingly.

      <td>## Description

Now the sidebar uses `dvh` units to adjust it's size for parts of the browser viewport that resize dynamically, e.g. address bar disappearing/appearing, etc.

I've tested this on an iPhone, but not Android. @adiati98, or someone with an Android phone, let me know if it resolves the issue. Thanks in advance!
