[Create a branch](https://www.shellhacks.com/git-create-new-branch-and-checkout/) with a name that relates with your contribution.<br><br>**OR**<br><br>**Manually write the instructions**.

        <td>Currently, we have this language <br><br>&gt; If you are interested in joining Virtual Coffee, you can join the waiting list or receive an invite from a current member. Once we&#39;ve accepted and added you to our membership, you will receive an email with links to our Coffees.<br><br><br>on [the FAQs.](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/join-virtual-coffee#1-join-the-waiting-list-or-receive-an-invite).<br><br>This can be confusing. It either needs to say &quot;an active volunteer&quot; or we leave that part out altogether. I&#39;m leaning towards the former.</td>
