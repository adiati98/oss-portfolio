      <td>### Describe the bug

When I click a link to a highlight on X or open it in a browser on mobile phone, the highlight card overflow as screenshot below:

**Highlight card on X on mobile phone**

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open the X app on your phone. 
2. Click the highlight link in a post. [Here](https://x.com/BekahHW/status/1707150470807245110?s=20) is an example of a post with a highlight link.
3. You will see that the card overflows.

      <td><a href='https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/issues/7'>feat: Improve Documentation</a></td>
      <td>## Description

There are rooms for documentation improvement here. The aim is to give clear explanations and instructions for contributors, especially those who are new to open source.
Right now, the README is a bit challenging to navigate for people who come to this repository for the first time. And there are also essential things missing in this repository.

## Suggestions

### Add a license

Without a license, this repository is automatically licensed under "All Rights Reserved" which means that no one may use, modify, or redistribute anything in the project unless the owner gives them permission to do so.

**Suggestion**:

Add a `LICENSE` file to this repo and link the license in its section on the README. [This website](https://www.tldrlegal.com/) is very helpful in explaining software licenses in plain English. [MIT License](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) is one of licenses that's used most in open source.

### Add a code of conduct

Having a code of conduct helps to maintain a safe and welcoming space for contributors. It will also help to moderate contributions and communication going on.

**Suggestion**:

Use the community's code of conduct and put it in a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file. Or use [a template from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project#adding-a-code-of-conduct-using-a-template) to add one.

### Change the title "Suggesting a Resource" to "Contributing Guide"

This section contains:
- Inviting contributors to submit resources.
- Navigate contributors to "How to submit your suggestion" — which contains the instructions to contribute.

**Suggestion**:

Having a straightforward title will give clarification about the section.

### Replace the `knowledge-hub/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md` with `CONTRIBUTING.md` that will live in the root.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` is a well-known file accross open-source projects that serves as a guide for contributors.

**Suggestion**:

Replacing the `knowledge-hub/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md` with `CONTRIBUTING.md` will help SheSharp members to get familiar with the file and know where to find it in a repository when they contribute to other OSS projects.

Also mention here what type of resources that this project accepts for contributions.

### Move the "[Randstad Housing Resources](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#randstad-housing-resources)" and "[Organizations that help women and non-binary people break into tech](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#organizations-that-help-women-and-non-binary-people-break-into-tech)" in the README to their own files.

There is the table of content in the README. However, it's confusing to see various things going on in the README.

For example, it's stated in the introduction:

> The resources collected here cover different areas, such as software development, data analysis, product management and quality assurance.

But there are other resources outside what stated there.

This suggestion also comes from a consideration that potentially the list in the resources will get longer and SheSharp may add new resources type, for example, "Job hunt resources", "Resources for moms in tech", etc.

**Suggestion**:

Move the resources to their own files and link these files on the README, but not having their content in the README.

### [Social Media](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#social-media) section

**Suggestion**:

- Adjust the title to "SheSharp Members' Social Media" or something like that to clarify that only the SheSharp members are on the list, except if this repository is accepting socials from outside of the community members.
- Having the social media section (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub profiles, etc.) on the README is great. But when it's getting much longer, consider to move it to its own file.

### How to communicate

There is this sentence in the contributing guide:

> If you need any help, feel free to raise an issue.

It would be best to give this sentence more attention so contributors can find it quickly.

**Suggestion**:

Give it a section on the README called "Do You Have Questions?" or "Community" or anything else that suits the needs.

This section will contain:
- When contributors need help, have questions or ideas, where do they need to go? — Slack (and which channel), raise an issue, or using [Discussion board](https://github.com/features/discussions)?
- Optional — if someone wants to contribute but not a SheSharp member, how to join SheSharp?

### Is this repository receiving contributions from members only?

**Suggestion**:

If this repo receives contributions from members only, make it clear by mentioning about it in the introduction on the README. Otherwise, state that everyone are encouraged to contribute.

### Clarify the [Step by step](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md#step-by-step) section.

Not everybody knows the syntax on how to clone, create a new branch, commit, etc.

**Suggestion**:

A clarification on how to do the actions would help beginners in open source to contribute to this repo.

There are a couple of ways to do this:

**Linking each step to a resource**. For example:

3. [Create a branch](https://www.shellhacks.com/git-create-new-branch-and-checkout/) with a name that relates with your contribution.

**OR**

**Manually write the instructions**. For example:

3. Create a branch with a name that relates with your contribution.
      Run this command in your terminal to create a new branch and navigate to it:
  
      ```bash
      git checkout -b <branch-name>
      ```

      For example:

      ```bash
      git checkout -b feat/add-ayu-linkedin
      ```

We have a Preptember repo walkthrough video posted on Slack.
It would be good to embed the video in the README as part of the intro so our members can also watch it here.

## Propose Solution

@dominicduffin1, as per discussion:
- Let's embed the video after the first paragraph, before the "Contributing" section.
- Have an opening sentence before the video, something like,"You can watch ..."</td>

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over "by hand."

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `app > routes > newsletter > issues` and create a new file `2023-09.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `app > routes > newsletter > issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in [Newsletters section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

If you have questions, please let us know. We're up for pairing if anyone wants to walk through this!</td>

🍕 Feature

### Current behavior

This repository is using CLI to add contributors to the `README.md` file.

However, there is also a suggestion in the README:

> ... we recommend actually editing the `.all-contributorsrc` file to get more experience with pull requests and reviews.

Does this mean that we are suggesting contributors to add themselves manually in the file? 

### Suggested solution

If we want to encourage contributors to add themselves manually to the file, we also want to provide instructions on how to do so.

Currently, when we create or edit a highlight and select a date, the latest created/edited highlight goes to the top (see attached gif).

It would be nice if the order of the highlights are based on the selected date from the latest to the oldest (or vice versa).

      <td>### Type of feature

🍕 Feature

### Current behavior

At the moment the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/100-days-of-oss-template#getting-started) section is as below:

  1. Fork this repository
  2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
  3. Create a new branch for each day of the challenge if you want to keep your work separate
  4. Commit your work to your branch
  5. Push your changes to your forked repository
  6. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch of your forked repository
  7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each day of the challenge

And the first bullet point in the tips section is:
> - Use the `table-of-contents.md` file to keep track of your work

#### The Concern

Probably folks who are not familiar with open source would get confused because of the lack of details and clarifications. Questions such as "Where should I write my progress? Is it in the `table-of-contents.md` or in other files?" "How to clone the repo and do commits?" etc. may arise.

### Suggested solution

- Add a couple of numbers in the Getting Started section to clarify the process. For example:

3. Create a new branch for each day ...
4. Create a new file and name it anything you like, e.g., `my-oss-journal.md`.  This will be the place where you update your #100DaysofOSS progress.
5. Use the template in the `journal.md` to record your progress.
6. Commit ...

- Make a nested bullet point in the [Tips](https://github.com/open-sauced/100-days-of-oss-template#tips-for-making-the-most-out-of-100daysofoss) section to explain how to update the `table-of-content.md` file. Something like:

  - Use the `table-of-contents.md` file to keep track of your work. To update the Table of Contents:
    - Open the `my-oss-journal.md` file (your progress journal file) on GitHub.
    - Click on the link icon at title of the day and copy the link.
    - Paste the link in the `table-of-contents.md`;
    
      ```

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Context for documentation change

- As we now have new paths for our resources, we need to update some links in our README and CONTRIBUTING files. Currently they direct to 404 page.

  README:
  > If you're new to open source, check out our [Git & GitHub 101](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/open-source/git-101) and [Contributor Guide](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/open-source/contributor-guide) resources.

  CONTRIBUTING:
  > If you feel like you have an issue that doesn't match those categories, go ahead and ignore the templates and create an issue the old-fashioned way. You can refer to our resource on [how to write an issue](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/open-source/contributor-guide#how-to-write-an-issue).

- Although it will direct to the correct link if we open it on computer, the link below redirect back to README when it's opened with the GitHub app on mobile phone. We need to update the link below from `master` to `main`.

  > Please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Proposed solution

Fix the links to the right paths.

Currently, we have some titles that contain links in our resources. We want to remove them and move them to the content to allow people to read them instead of going directly to the link in the titles because we have valuable information to share.

      <td>### Type of feature

🍕 Feature

### Current behavior

I don't know if this is true for paid users or only for those who use coupon codes.

I upgraded access using the coupon code to access Open Sauced paid features for 12 months.

Credit card details that contain sensitive information were required in the process. But I can't find information about the subscription, such as if I already subscribed, the subscription expiration date, billing information, etc. I also didn't get a confirmation email.
I believe I have access to it because I don't see the "Upgrade Access" button on the "User setting" anymore.

I also can't find information on whether the subscription is automatically extended and if paid users will get a notification when their subscription expires and choose to extend or terminate it. 

### Suggested solution

- A dashboard about the paid user's subscription/plan. This may include billing information, subscription expiry date, and maybe a payment method (credit card with ending number — perhaps the user has multiple cards and needs clarification on which card they use — and the expiry date).

- A confirmation email about the subscription. 

- Information (maybe at FAQ?) about:
  - if users will get a notification before the subscription expires and whether they want to extend or cancel it.
  - if the subscription is automatically extended or not.

      <td>## Issue Context

Our podcast's transcriptions are automatically generated, so there would be typos or missing words. 

We want to improve every episode's transcription so they can be accessible to everyone. Currently, we are doing this manually.

## Steps To Update

- Open the file of the podcast's episode. 
  e.g.: `1_0.srt` means season 1 episode 0
-  Listen to the podcast's episode and improve the transcript based on your hearing.
-  [Fix the format](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/podcast-transcripts#fixing-formatting-issues) by running `yarn check-srt`.
- After running `yarn check-srt`, fix timestamps suggestions format manually, if any.
