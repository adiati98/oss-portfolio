      <td>## Description<br><br>There are rooms for documentation improvement here. The aim is to give clear explanations and instructions for contributors, especially those who are new to open source.<br>Right now, the README is a bit challenging to navigate for people who come to this repository for the first time. And there are also essential things missing in this repository.<br><br>## Suggestions<br><br>### Add a license<br><br>Without a license, this repository is automatically licensed under &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot; which means that no one may use, modify, or redistribute anything in the project unless the owner gives them permission to do so.<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>Add a `LICENSE` file to this repo and link the license in its section on the README. [This website](https://www.tldrlegal.com/) is very helpful in explaining software licenses in plain English. [MIT License](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) is one of licenses that&#39;s used most in open source.<br><br>### Add a code of conduct<br><br>Having a code of conduct helps to maintain a safe and welcoming space for contributors. It will also help to moderate contributions and communication going on.<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>Use the community&#39;s code of conduct and put it in a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file. Or use [a template from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project#adding-a-code-of-conduct-using-a-template) to add one.<br><br>### Change the title &quot;Suggesting a Resource&quot; to &quot;Contributing Guide&quot;<br><br>This section contains:<br>- Inviting contributors to submit resources.<br>- Navigate contributors to &quot;How to submit your suggestion&quot; — which contains the instructions to contribute.<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>Having a straightforward title will give clarification about the section.<br><br>### Replace the `knowledge-hub/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md` with `CONTRIBUTING.md` that will live in the root.<br><br>`CONTRIBUTING.md` is a well-known file accross open-source projects that serves as a guide for contributors.<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>Replacing the `knowledge-hub/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md` with `CONTRIBUTING.md` will help SheSharp members to get familiar with the file and know where to find it in a repository when they contribute to other OSS projects.<br><br>Also mention here what type of resources that this project accepts for contributions.<br><br>### Move the &quot;[Randstad Housing Resources](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#randstad-housing-resources)&quot; and &quot;[Organizations that help women and non-binary people break into tech](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#organizations-that-help-women-and-non-binary-people-break-into-tech)&quot; in the README to their own files.<br><br>There is the table of content in the README. However, it&#39;s confusing to see various things going on in the README.<br><br>For example, it&#39;s stated in the introduction:<br><br>&gt; The resources collected here cover different areas, such as software development, data analysis, product management and quality assurance.<br><br>But there are other resources outside what stated there.<br><br>This suggestion also comes from a consideration that potentially the list in the resources will get longer and SheSharp may add new resources type, for example, &quot;Job hunt resources&quot;, &quot;Resources for moms in tech&quot;, etc.<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>Move the resources to their own files and link these files on the README, but not having their content in the README.<br><br>### [Social Media](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#social-media) section<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>- Adjust the title to &quot;SheSharp Members&#39; Social Media&quot; or something like that to clarify that only the SheSharp members are on the list, except if this repository is accepting socials from outside of the community members.<br>- Having the social media section (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub profiles, etc.) on the README is great. But when it&#39;s getting much longer, consider to move it to its own file.<br><br>### How to communicate<br><br>There is this sentence in the contributing guide:<br><br>&gt; If you need any help, feel free to raise an issue.<br><br>It would be best to give this sentence more attention so contributors can find it quickly.<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>Give it a section on the README called &quot;Do You Have Questions?&quot; or &quot;Community&quot; or anything else that suits the needs.<br><br>This section will contain:<br>- When contributors need help, have questions or ideas, where do they need to go? — Slack (and which channel), raise an issue, or using [Discussion board](https://github.com/features/discussions)?<br>- Optional — if someone wants to contribute but not a SheSharp member, how to join SheSharp?<br><br>### Is this repository receiving contributions from members only?<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>If this repo receives contributions from members only, make it clear by mentioning about it in the introduction on the README. Otherwise, state that everyone are encouraged to contribute.<br><br>### Clarify the [Step by step](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md#step-by-step) section.<br><br>Not everybody knows the syntax on how to clone, create a new branch, commit, etc.<br><br>**Suggestion**:<br><br>A clarification on how to do the actions would help beginners in open source to contribute to this repo.<br><br>There are a couple of ways to do this:<br><br>**Linking each step to a resource**. For example:<br><br>3. [Create a branch](https://www.shellhacks.com/git-create-new-branch-and-checkout/) with a name that relates with your contribution.<br><br>**OR**<br><br>**Manually write the instructions**. For example:<br><br>3. Create a branch with a name that relates with your contribution.<br>      Run this command in your terminal to create a new branch and navigate to it:<br>  <br>      ```bash<br>      git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt;<br>      ```<br><br>      For example:<br><br>      ```bash<br>      git checkout -b feat/add-ayu-linkedin<br>      ```<br><br><br> <br></td>

Fork this repository<br>  2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine<br>  3. Create a new branch for each day of the challenge if you want to keep your work separate<br>  4.

Questions such as &quot;Where should I write my progress? Is it in the `table-of-contents.md` or in other files?&quot; &quot;How to clone the repo and do commits?&quot; etc. may arise.<br><br>### Suggested solution<br><br>- Add a couple of numbers in the Getting Started section to clarify the process. For example:<br><br>3. Create a new branch for each day ...<br>4. Create a new file and name it anything you like, e.g., `my-oss-journal.md`.  This will be the place where you update your #100DaysofOSS progress.<br>5. Use the template in the `journal.md` to record your progress.<br>6. Commit ...<br><br>- Make a nested bullet point in the [Tips](https://github.com/open-sauced/100-days-of-oss-template#tips-for-making-the-most-out-of-100daysofoss) section to explain how to update the `table-of-content.md` file. Something like:<br><br>  - Use the `table-of-contents.md` file to keep track of your work. To update the Table of Contents:<br>    - Open the `my-oss-journal.md` file (your progress journal file) on GitHub.<br>    - Click on the link icon at title of the day and copy the link.<br>    - Paste the link in the `table-of-contents.md`;<br>    <br>      ```<br>      - [Day 1](link-to-day-1#day-1)<br>      ```<br>    - Follow the steps in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/100-days-of-oss-template#getting-started) to commit, push and create pull request to merge your changes into the main branch of your forked repository. <br><br>- Add code examples to clone, create a branch, commit, and push changes from local to remote environment.<br><br>### Additional context<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [X] I agree to follow this project&#39;s Code of Conduct<br><br>### Contributing Docs<br><br>- [X] I agree to follow this project&#39;s Contribution Docs</td>
