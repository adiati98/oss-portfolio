      <td>## Issue Context

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over "by hand."

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `app > routes > newsletter > issues` and create a new file `2023-03.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `app > routes > newsletter > issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in [Newsletters section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

If you have questions, please let us know. We're up for pairing if anyone wants to walk through this!</td>

      <td>## Issue Context

Our podcast's transcriptions are automatically generated, so there would be typos or missing words. 

We want to improve every episode's transcription so they can be accessible to everyone. Currently, we are doing this manually.

## Steps To Update

- Open the file of the podcast's episode. 
  e.g.: `1_0.srt` means season 1 episode 0
-  Listen to the podcast's episode and improve the transcript based on your hearing.
-  [Fix the format](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/podcast-transcripts#fixing-formatting-issues) by running `yarn check-srt`.
- After running `yarn check-srt`, fix timestamps suggestions format manually, if any.
