      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?<br><br>- [X] I have searched the existing issues<br><br>### What happened?<br><br>## Description<br><br>- Some pages have horizontal scroll in mobile phone (smaller screen). It happens because of the `&lt;h2&gt;` font size. Please screen record attached.<br><br>https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/assets/45172775/eb3589b4-bdb0-4754-b8e1-8f187f2421f2<br><br>- The font size of `&lt;h1&gt;` looks much smaller than `&lt;h2&gt;`.<br>- **This one is a friendly suggestion**: It would be nice to have top margin/padding for `&lt;h1&gt;`  to seperate it from the hero image.<br><br>  Please see screenshots attached for two points above:<br><br>`&lt;h1&gt;` <br><br>  ![h1](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/assets/45172775/95af43b1-6a56-4002-99ff-868fdb0248c1)<br><br> `&lt;h2&gt;`<br><br>  ![h2](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/assets/45172775/6f7bd891-bdba-4674-9889-589420f40380)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>### Steps To Reproduce<br><br>1. Open [Burnout page on VC website](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/developer-health/burnout) on mobile phone.<br>2. Now you can see that there&#39;s a horizontal scroll on the page, and the `&lt;h2&gt;` font looks bigger than the `&lt;h1&gt;`.<br><br>### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?<br><br>Chrome<br><br>### Environment<br><br>```markdown<br>- OS: Android 13<br>```<br><br><br>### Anything else?<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [X] I&#39;ve read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community</td>
