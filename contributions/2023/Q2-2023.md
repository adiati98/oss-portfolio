A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (‚Äú @username I want to know what you think of this code.‚Äù)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### What happened?

## Description

- Some pages have horizontal scroll in mobile phone (smaller screen). It happens because of the `&lt;h2&gt;` font size. Please screen record attached.

https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/assets/45172775/eb3589b4-bdb0-4754-b8e1-8f187f2421f2

- The font size of `&lt;h1&gt;` looks much smaller than `&lt;h2&gt;`.
- **This one is a friendly suggestion**: It would be nice to have top margin/padding for `&lt;h1&gt;`  to seperate it from the hero image.

  Please see screenshots attached for two points above:

`&lt;h1&gt;` 

  ![h1](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/assets/45172775/95af43b1-6a56-4002-99ff-868fdb0248c1)

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Open [Burnout page on VC website](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/developer-health/burnout) on mobile phone.
2. Now you can see that there's a horizontal scroll on the page, and the `&lt;h2&gt;` font looks bigger than the `&lt;h1&gt;`.
