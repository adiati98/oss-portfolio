### What happened?

## Description

- Some pages have horizontal scroll in mobile phone (smaller screen). It happens because of the `<h2>` font size. Please screen record attached.

- The font size of `<h1>` looks much smaller than `<h2>`.
- **This one is a friendly suggestion**: It would be nice to have top margin/padding for `<h1>`  to seperate it from the hero image.

  Please see screenshots attached for two points above:

`<h1>`

 `<h2>`

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Open [Burnout page on VC website](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/developer-health/burnout) on mobile phone.
2. Now you can see that there's a horizontal scroll on the page, and the `<h2>` font looks bigger than the `<h1>`.

I have been looking around for transcriptions-related linceses, and found that [se-unlocked podcast](https://github.com/mgreiler/se-unlocked) is using [Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/) as their license for their transcripts repo.

So, we might as well using this license for our podcast-transcripts repo.</td>
