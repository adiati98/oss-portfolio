<!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

-->

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

Windows users encounter lint error of `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` because the default behavior of git on Windows systems is to convert LF linebreaks to CRLF when checking out files, but to store the linebreaks as LF when committing a change.

This PR adds a `.gitattributes` file and normalize all line endings in `.ts` files to make it easy for developers to contribute from different platforms.

This PR holds changes as follow:

- Fixed unordered list.
- Fixed Markdown for code blocks.
- Fixed and adjusted headings.
- Adjusted wordings across the docs.
- Reorganized instructions.
- Removed duplicate Markdown examples.
- Changed examples with concrete examples based on our course.
- Added a step to ensure the chapter's numbers are in order to "Adding a New Chapter" and "Adding New Chapters to the Sidebar" sections. 
- Changed the word "sections" to "chapters" for consistency.
- Removed step 1 in the "Adding a New Chapter" section below as this repo doesn't have a docs folder
  
 > 1. **Locate the documentation folder**
   > Navigate to the folder in this repository where the documentation is stored in the [open-sauced / intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro). Typically, this folder is named "docs" i.e. [open-sauced / docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs).

- Added a section called "Working with the Content" to hold subsections below:
  - Adding Definitions to the Glossary — NEW
  - Adding a New Section to a Chapter — NEW 
  - Adding a New Chapter and Adding it to the Sidebar
- Added a pragraph in the "Issues" section about raising an issue and tagging maintainers for triage.
- Changed "Go Live feature" with "Live Server extension" because after I did research, there is no feature called "Go Live" in VS Code.
- Highlighted inline code for more clarity.
- Added tree directory for the examples in "Adding Translations to Documentation" section.
- Moved "Adding Translations to Documentation" to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Added "Translating the Intro to Open Source Course" section to link the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organized "How Can I Contribute?" section in the `i18n-guidelines.md`.

<!--

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

## Methodology

<!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Note for Reviewers

- Because there is CLI involved for this project, screen recordings (GIFs) will be more clear than screenshots. So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.

-  One of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run `npm run contributors:generate` to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --> this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.

- Once this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.

- Videos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.

5. Click "PROBLEMS" tab on the panel bar.

      <td>### Describe the bug

When I wanted to give a reaction to a highlight, the icon shuts down right away (in milliseconds) every time I click it.

Below is the screen recording. It's hard to capture the state of the icon closing right away, so you might see as if nothing happens when clicking the icon button.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Click the bell icon on the top bar of your OpenSauced dashboard to open the notifications.
2. Click on a user's highlight. You will see the highlight's card.
3. Click the smiley button to give reaction to the highlight.
4. The icons will close immediately.

      <td><a href='https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/issues/24'>Docs: Remove "Using Markdown for This Project" section in Contributing Guide</a></td>
      <td>## Background

The "[Using Markdown for This Project](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-markdown-for-this-project)" section contains the Markdown convention we use at OpenSauced.

The first paragraph in the section mentioned that we have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) that located in the `pizza-verse` repository. However, this section is more comprehensive than the style guide.

Currently, we only have this section in the "Intro to OSS course" and "Maintainer Intro Course" repos. But there is a potential that we will refer this section to contributors who work on docs across repos.

We might want to consider having this in one place — the "[Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)" section in the Docs might be suitable for it — and link it to all docs-related repos. That way, we can also minimize the length of the Contributing Guidelines.

## Suggest Solution

- Move the "Using Markdown for This Project" section to the Contributing Guidelines in OpenSauced Docs.
- Change the title to "Markdown Style Guide".
- Adjust the content, if necessary, to be applicable to all repos.
- Link the Markdown guide from the Docs in the Contributing Guide of this repo with suggestion as below:

  ```markdown
  ## Markdown Style Guide

  Please follow our [Markdown Style Guide](<link to the docs>) for the Markdown convention that we use at OpenSauced when you contribute to this project.

      <td>## Describe the bug

When I worked on the `constants.ts` file, I get lots error messages: `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'`.
And this error happens in all TypeScript files.

### Screenshot

![Lint error](https://github.com/open-sauced/ai/assets/45172775/86f97741-2f81-43fd-b580-02e872a9b86a)

## Suggestion

After did some research, I found [the same problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37826449/expected-linebreaks-to-be-lf-but-found-crlf-linebreak-style), and it happens only for Windows users.

As I am using Windows 11, the solution to add the `linebreak-style` rule configuration for Windows in this thread works. I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:

```bash
rules {
  "linebreak-style": ["error", "unix"],
  "linebreak-style": ["error", "windows"],
}
```

However, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. 

### Alternative Solution

Adding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.

And here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.


## Steps to reproduce

On VS Code in the Windows machine:

1. Open any TypeScript file.
2. Click "PROBLEMS" tab on panel bar.
3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.

      <td>## Description

Outside of Hacktoberfest, most contributors who contribute to this repo are participants of our Intro to Open Source course. So I propose to remove the "Getting Started" and "Update Branch & Resolve Conflicts" sections and move them to the Intro to Open Source course. 

Moving these sections to the course will give 2 benefits:

1. As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.
2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course. That way, it can attracts folks to check out our course and potentially, recommend the course to others.

## Propose Solution

- Move the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) section from README to replace the content in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section in the course.
- Move the [Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#keeping-branch-up-to-date-and-resolving-merge-conflicts) from README to replace the [Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=merge-conflicts) section in the course.
- Link each section from "Intro to Open Source" course to the "Getting Started" and the "Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts" section in the README.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to a [user's card page](https://app.opensauced.pizza/user/adiati98/card).
2. Look at the front side of the dev card — can't see the text under the numbers.
3. Hover over — and still can't see the text under the numbers.
4. Click the card to see the back side of the dev card — can't see the "View Profile" button.
5. Hover over — can see most of the card, but the "View Profile" button is cut off.

After clicking a repo's graph in the "Activity" tab in the Lists Page, I can't go back to the previous graphs. I need to refresh the page to do so.

### Note

I found out through @nickytonline stream that we can go back by clicking the "Repos" word.
But I think this would be confusing for users as there is no indication that they should click the "Repos" to go back.

### Suggestion

Perhaps having a button with the text "back" or adding/showing an underline (like a link) at "Repos" text to indicate that it's clickable would help.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the Lists page.
2. Click any list.
3. Click "Activity" tab.
4. Click one of the repo stats on the right.
5. How to get back to the previous stats with all the repo?

      <td>## Description

There are things that can be improved in the README as follows:

1. Fix wordings.

   - OpenSauced has several websites. And currently, in the Getting Started section, we have a link to the Intro to OSS website with text "opensauced" (with no capital letters).
   - In the [Building Your Open Source Resume](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#building-your-open-source-resume) section, there's a suggestion to read the "Building Your Open Source Resume" section in chapter 6. However, there is no section with this title. Instead, there is a [Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume) section.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Currently, there are 5 chapters mentioned in this section. But we have 6 chapters now, including [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) .

3. There is no link to our i18n guidelines in the [🤝 Contributing to this Repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-to-this-repository) section.

## Suggestion

1. Fix wordings

   - Change the link text of the website to "Intro to Open Source course" to clarify the target website.

     ```markdown
     ... visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/) website and start reading!
     ```
   - There are two options to update the title in the "Building Your Open Source Resume" section:
  
     1. Change "Building Your Open Source Resume" to "Develop your Open Source Resume" to match the course.
     2. Change the title in the course from "[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)" to "Building Your Open Source Resume".

     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.

3. Add a link to i18n Guidelines for translation.</td>

The chapter [Understanding Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/11-understanding-merge-conflicts) currently lives at the end of the intro course, right after "Glossary".
It would make more sense if it becomes a section rather than a standalone chapter.
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter will be suitable to hold this section.

## Suggestion

Move this section into the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter, right after [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section.

If you don't find any folder that is suitable for your resource:

- Create a new markdown file in the `resources` folder. For example, `job-hunting.md`.

🌟 Hi there! We're excited to hear your suggestions and ideas for making this project better. Thank you for contributing to our community!

## Description

There is a Table of Content in the README file, however, it's quite all over the place without a title.

![SheSharp TOC](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/assets/45172775/a3fe549a-a2f2-4582-89ce-9896e0e4f503)

<!-- Describe your suggestion or improvement in a few sentences. What would you like to see added, changed, or enhanced? -->

## Motivation

Having a title for the Table of Content and make it a section will make the README tidier.

<!-- Help us understand why you think this suggestion is valuable. How would it benefit the project or community? -->

## Implementation (if applicable)

- Add an `h2` with text: Table of Contents.
- Remove the first `<li>` (SheSharp Knowledge Hub) as we don't need to navigate to it from the Table of Content.

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>

      <td>## Issue Context

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over "by hand."

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `app > routes > newsletter > issues` and create a new file `2023-10.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `app > routes > newsletter > issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in [Newsletters section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

      <td># Suggestion/Improvement

🌟 Hi there! We're excited to hear your suggestions and ideas for making this project better. Thank you for contributing to our community!

## Description

<!-- Describe your suggestion or improvement in a few sentences. What would you like to see added, changed, or enhanced? -->

After previewing a written issue, commenting out the questions/instuctions in the issue templates would give more clarity to read the issue.

## Motivation

<!-- Help us understand why you think this suggestion is valuable. How would it benefit the project or community? -->

When a contributor doesn't delete the instructions when they write an issue, it makes harder for maintainers/triage team to review the issue. But commenting out the issue would not give any problems for contributors.

### Screenshots

Below are examples screenshot of result before and after commenting out the instructions:

      <td>## Description
Lately, there has been a handful of Pull Requests that missed the step of generating profile and badge on the README. So, @adiati98, @BekahHW, and I agreed that the PR template needs a section called "Screenshot" with instructions after the "Added to documentation?" section.  By providing this information, maintainers would have an easier time reviewing PRs and ensuring that contributors followed the steps to adding their profile.

This happening because there is an id referenced in the sidebar file that not longer exists so I removed it and now it runs fine.
