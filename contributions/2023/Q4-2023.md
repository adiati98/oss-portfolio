A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

Windows users encounter lint error of `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` because the default behavior of git on Windows systems is to convert LF linebreaks to CRLF when checking out files, but to store the linebreaks as LF when committing a change.

This PR adds a `.gitattributes` file and normalize all line endings in `.ts` files to make it easy for developers to contribute from different platforms.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

- Fixed Markdown for code blocks.
- Fixed and adjusted headings.
- Adjusted wordings across the docs.

- Changed examples with concrete examples based on our course.

- Removed step 1 in the &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; section below as this repo doesn't have a docs folder
  
 &gt; 1. **Locate the documentation folder**
   &gt; Navigate to the folder in this repository where the documentation is stored in the [open-sauced / intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro). Typically, this folder is named &quot;docs&quot; i.e. [open-sauced / docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs).

- Added a section called &quot;Working with the Content&quot; to hold subsections below:
  - Adding Definitions to the Glossary — NEW

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR adds the Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts section to walk through the process for this project.

## Note for Reviewers

- Because there is CLI involved for this project, screen recordings (GIFs) will be more clear than screenshots. So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.

-  One of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run `npm run contributors:generate` to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --&gt; this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.

- Once this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.

- Videos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

Windows users encounter lint error of `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` because the default behavior of git on Windows systems is to convert LF linebreaks to CRLF when checking out files, but to store the linebreaks as LF when committing a change.

This PR adds a `.gitattributes` file and normalize all line endings in `.ts` files to make it easy for developers to contribute from different platforms.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR holds changes as follow:

- Fixed unordered list.
- Fixed Markdown for code blocks.
- Fixed and adjusted headings.
- Adjusted wordings across the docs.
- Reorganized instructions.
- Removed duplicate Markdown examples.
- Changed examples with concrete examples based on our course.
- Added a step to ensure the chapter's numbers are in order to &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; and &quot;Adding New Chapters to the Sidebar&quot; sections. 
- Changed the word &quot;sections&quot; to &quot;chapters&quot; for consistency.
- Removed step 1 in the &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; section below as this repo doesn't have a docs folder
  
 &gt; 1. **Locate the documentation folder**
   &gt; Navigate to the folder in this repository where the documentation is stored in the [open-sauced / intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro). Typically, this folder is named &quot;docs&quot; i.e. [open-sauced / docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs).

- Added a section called &quot;Working with the Content&quot; to hold subsections below:
  - Adding Definitions to the Glossary — NEW
  - Adding a New Section to a Chapter — NEW 
  - Adding a New Chapter and Adding it to the Sidebar
- Added a pragraph in the &quot;Issues&quot; section about raising an issue and tagging maintainers for triage.
- Changed &quot;Go Live feature&quot; with &quot;Live Server extension&quot; because after I did research, there is no feature called &quot;Go Live&quot; in VS Code.
- Highlighted inline code for more clarity.
- Added tree directory for the examples in &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; section.
- Moved &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Added &quot;Translating the Intro to Open Source Course&quot; section to link the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organized &quot;How Can I Contribute?&quot; section in the `i18n-guidelines.md`.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR adds the Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts section to walk through the process for this project.

## Note for Reviewers

- Because there is CLI involved for this project, screen recordings (GIFs) will be more clear than screenshots. So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.

-  One of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run `npm run contributors:generate` to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --&gt; this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.

- Once this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.

- Videos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

Windows users encounter lint error of `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` because the default behavior of git on Windows systems is to convert LF linebreaks to CRLF when checking out files, but to store the linebreaks as LF when committing a change.

This PR adds a `.gitattributes` file and normalize all line endings in `.ts` files to make it easy for developers to contribute from different platforms.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

If you have a pull request related to a current issue please link to that issue number.

That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue.

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type the keyword &quot;Closes&quot; followed by a reference to the issue. For example, Closes #404 or Closes Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/404.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR holds changes as follow:

- Fixed unordered list.
- Fixed Markdown for code blocks.
- Fixed and adjusted headings.
- Adjusted wordings across the docs.
- Reorganized instructions.
- Removed duplicate Markdown examples.
- Changed examples with concrete examples based on our course.
- Added a step to ensure the chapter's numbers are in order to &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; and &quot;Adding New Chapters to the Sidebar&quot; sections. 
- Changed the word &quot;sections&quot; to &quot;chapters&quot; for consistency.
- Removed step 1 in the &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; section below as this repo doesn't have a docs folder
  
 &gt; 1. **Locate the documentation folder**
   &gt; Navigate to the folder in this repository where the documentation is stored in the [open-sauced / intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro). Typically, this folder is named &quot;docs&quot; i.e. [open-sauced / docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs).

- Added a section called &quot;Working with the Content&quot; to hold subsections below:
  - Adding Definitions to the Glossary — NEW
  - Adding a New Section to a Chapter — NEW 
  - Adding a New Chapter and Adding it to the Sidebar
- Added a pragraph in the &quot;Issues&quot; section about raising an issue and tagging maintainers for triage.
- Changed &quot;Go Live feature&quot; with &quot;Live Server extension&quot; because after I did research, there is no feature called &quot;Go Live&quot; in VS Code.
- Highlighted inline code for more clarity.
- Added tree directory for the examples in &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; section.
- Moved &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Added &quot;Translating the Intro to Open Source Course&quot; section to link the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organized &quot;How Can I Contribute?&quot; section in the `i18n-guidelines.md`.

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR adds the Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts section to walk through the process for this project.

## Note for Reviewers

- Because there is CLI involved for this project, screen recordings (GIFs) will be more clear than screenshots. So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.

-  One of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run `npm run contributors:generate` to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --&gt; this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.

- Once this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.

- Videos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.

This PR updates Ayu's member profile with:
- Hacktoberfest2023 badge
- Location

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

Windows users encounter lint error of `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` because the default behavior of git on Windows systems is to convert LF linebreaks to CRLF when checking out files, but to store the linebreaks as LF when committing a change.

This PR adds a `.gitattributes` file and normalize all line endings in `.ts` files to make it easy for developers to contribute from different platforms.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR holds changes as follow:

- Fixed unordered list.
- Fixed Markdown for code blocks.
- Fixed and adjusted headings.
- Adjusted wordings across the docs.
- Reorganized instructions.
- Removed duplicate Markdown examples.
- Changed examples with concrete examples based on our course.
- Added a step to ensure the chapter's numbers are in order to &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; and &quot;Adding New Chapters to the Sidebar&quot; sections. 
- Changed the word &quot;sections&quot; to &quot;chapters&quot; for consistency.
- Removed step 1 in the &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; section below as this repo doesn't have a docs folder
  
 &gt; 1. **Locate the documentation folder**
   &gt; Navigate to the folder in this repository where the documentation is stored in the [open-sauced / intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro). Typically, this folder is named &quot;docs&quot; i.e. [open-sauced / docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs).

- Added a section called &quot;Working with the Content&quot; to hold subsections below:
  - Adding Definitions to the Glossary — NEW
  - Adding a New Section to a Chapter — NEW 
  - Adding a New Chapter and Adding it to the Sidebar
- Added a pragraph in the &quot;Issues&quot; section about raising an issue and tagging maintainers for triage.
- Changed &quot;Go Live feature&quot; with &quot;Live Server extension&quot; because after I did research, there is no feature called &quot;Go Live&quot; in VS Code.
- Highlighted inline code for more clarity.
- Added tree directory for the examples in &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; section.
- Moved &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Added &quot;Translating the Intro to Open Source Course&quot; section to link the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organized &quot;How Can I Contribute?&quot; section in the `i18n-guidelines.md`.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR adds the Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts section to walk through the process for this project.

## Note for Reviewers

- Because there is CLI involved for this project, screen recordings (GIFs) will be more clear than screenshots. So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.

-  One of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run `npm run contributors:generate` to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --&gt; this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.

- Once this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.

- Videos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

Windows users encounter lint error of `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` because the default behavior of git on Windows systems is to convert LF linebreaks to CRLF when checking out files, but to store the linebreaks as LF when committing a change.

This PR adds a `.gitattributes` file and normalize all line endings in `.ts` files to make it easy for developers to contribute from different platforms.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR holds changes as follow:

- Fixed unordered list.
- Fixed Markdown for code blocks.
- Fixed and adjusted headings.
- Adjusted wordings across the docs.
- Reorganized instructions.
- Removed duplicate Markdown examples.
- Changed examples with concrete examples based on our course.
- Added a step to ensure the chapter's numbers are in order to &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; and &quot;Adding New Chapters to the Sidebar&quot; sections. 
- Changed the word &quot;sections&quot; to &quot;chapters&quot; for consistency.
- Removed step 1 in the &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; section below as this repo doesn't have a docs folder
  
 &gt; 1. **Locate the documentation folder**
   &gt; Navigate to the folder in this repository where the documentation is stored in the [open-sauced / intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro). Typically, this folder is named &quot;docs&quot; i.e. [open-sauced / docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs).

- Added a section called &quot;Working with the Content&quot; to hold subsections below:
  - Adding Definitions to the Glossary — NEW
  - Adding a New Section to a Chapter — NEW 
  - Adding a New Chapter and Adding it to the Sidebar
- Added a pragraph in the &quot;Issues&quot; section about raising an issue and tagging maintainers for triage.
- Changed &quot;Go Live feature&quot; with &quot;Live Server extension&quot; because after I did research, there is no feature called &quot;Go Live&quot; in VS Code.
- Highlighted inline code for more clarity.
- Added tree directory for the examples in &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; section.
- Moved &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Added &quot;Translating the Intro to Open Source Course&quot; section to link the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organized &quot;How Can I Contribute?&quot; section in the `i18n-guidelines.md`.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR adds the Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts section to walk through the process for this project.

## Note for Reviewers

- Because there is CLI involved for this project, screen recordings (GIFs) will be more clear than screenshots. So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.

-  One of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run `npm run contributors:generate` to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --&gt; this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.

- Once this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.

- Videos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

Windows users encounter lint error of `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` because the default behavior of git on Windows systems is to convert LF linebreaks to CRLF when checking out files, but to store the linebreaks as LF when committing a change.

This PR adds a `.gitattributes` file and normalize all line endings in `.ts` files to make it easy for developers to contribute from different platforms.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR holds changes as follow:

- Fixed unordered list.
- Fixed Markdown for code blocks.
- Fixed and adjusted headings.
- Adjusted wordings across the docs.
- Reorganized instructions.
- Removed duplicate Markdown examples.
- Changed examples with concrete examples based on our course.
- Added a step to ensure the chapter's numbers are in order to &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; and &quot;Adding New Chapters to the Sidebar&quot; sections. 
- Changed the word &quot;sections&quot; to &quot;chapters&quot; for consistency.
- Removed step 1 in the &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; section below as this repo doesn't have a docs folder
  
 &gt; 1. **Locate the documentation folder**
   &gt; Navigate to the folder in this repository where the documentation is stored in the [open-sauced / intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro). Typically, this folder is named &quot;docs&quot; i.e. [open-sauced / docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs).

- Added a section called &quot;Working with the Content&quot; to hold subsections below:
  - Adding Definitions to the Glossary — NEW
  - Adding a New Section to a Chapter — NEW 
  - Adding a New Chapter and Adding it to the Sidebar
- Added a pragraph in the &quot;Issues&quot; section about raising an issue and tagging maintainers for triage.
- Changed &quot;Go Live feature&quot; with &quot;Live Server extension&quot; because after I did research, there is no feature called &quot;Go Live&quot; in VS Code.
- Highlighted inline code for more clarity.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

## Note for Reviewers

- Because there is CLI involved for this project, screen recordings (GIFs) will be more clear than screenshots. So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.

-  One of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run `npm run contributors:generate` to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --&gt; this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.

- Once this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.

- Videos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

Windows users encounter lint error of `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` because the default behavior of git on Windows systems is to convert LF linebreaks to CRLF when checking out files, but to store the linebreaks as LF when committing a change.

This PR adds a `.gitattributes` file and normalize all line endings in `.ts` files to make it easy for developers to contribute from different platforms.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

      <td>## Description

This PR holds changes as follow:

- Fixed unordered list.
- Fixed Markdown for code blocks.
- Fixed and adjusted headings.
- Adjusted wordings across the docs.
- Reorganized instructions.
- Removed duplicate Markdown examples.
- Changed examples with concrete examples based on our course.
- Added a step to ensure the chapter's numbers are in order to &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; and &quot;Adding New Chapters to the Sidebar&quot; sections. 
- Changed the word &quot;sections&quot; to &quot;chapters&quot; for consistency.
- Removed step 1 in the &quot;Adding a New Chapter&quot; section below as this repo doesn't have a docs folder
  
 &gt; 1. **Locate the documentation folder**
   &gt; Navigate to the folder in this repository where the documentation is stored in the [open-sauced / intro](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro). Typically, this folder is named &quot;docs&quot; i.e. [open-sauced / docs](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs).

- Added a section called &quot;Working with the Content&quot; to hold subsections below:
  - Adding Definitions to the Glossary — NEW
  - Adding a New Section to a Chapter — NEW 
  - Adding a New Chapter and Adding it to the Sidebar
- Added a pragraph in the &quot;Issues&quot; section about raising an issue and tagging maintainers for triage.
- Changed &quot;Go Live feature&quot; with &quot;Live Server extension&quot; because after I did research, there is no feature called &quot;Go Live&quot; in VS Code.
- Highlighted inline code for more clarity.
- Added tree directory for the examples in &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; section.
- Moved &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Added &quot;Translating the Intro to Open Source Course&quot; section to link the `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organized &quot;How Can I Contribute?&quot; section in the `i18n-guidelines.md`.

A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.

It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.

A good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.

If the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.

@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why. (“ @username I want to know what you think of this code.”)

--&gt;

## Methodology

&lt;!--

This section explains why the above changes explained were done.

Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write &quot;Business/Product requirement&quot; in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.

If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.

A good &quot;Why&quot; section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.

This PR adds the Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts section to walk through the process for this project.

## Note for Reviewers

- Because there is CLI involved for this project, screen recordings (GIFs) will be more clear than screenshots. So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.

-  One of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run `npm run contributors:generate` to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --&gt; this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.

- Once this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.

- Videos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.

      <td>## Describe the bug

When I worked on the `Party.tsx` file, I got 75 error messages of &quot;Delete `CR` eslint(prettier/prettier)&quot;. I'm on Windows machine, so this error probably only affect Windows users.

1. Open VS Code in Windows machine.
2. Open any `.tsx` file.
3. You will see lots of red warnings in the file.
5. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on the panel bar.
6. You will see the details of the error: &quot;Delete `CR` eslint(prettier/prettier)&quot;.

## Expected behavior

This error should not occur.

## Suggested Solutions

Add rules to `eslint.cjs` file by setting set the `endOfLine` property to `auto`.

      <td>### Describe the bug

When I wanted to give a reaction to a highlight, the icon shuts down right away (in milliseconds) every time I click it.

Below is the screen recording. It's hard to capture the state of the icon closing right away, so you might see as if nothing happens when clicking the icon button.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Click the bell icon on the top bar of your OpenSauced dashboard to open the notifications.
2. Click on a user's highlight. You will see the highlight's card.
3. Click the smiley button to give reaction to the highlight.
4. The icons will close immediately.

      <td>## Background

The &quot;[Using Markdown for This Project](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-markdown-for-this-project)&quot; section contains the Markdown convention we use at OpenSauced.

The first paragraph in the section mentioned that we have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) that located in the `pizza-verse` repository. However, this section is more comprehensive than the style guide.

Currently, we only have this section in the &quot;Intro to OSS course&quot; and &quot;Maintainer Intro Course&quot; repos. But there is a potential that we will refer this section to contributors who work on docs across repos.

We might want to consider having this in one place — the &quot;[Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)&quot; section in the Docs might be suitable for it — and link it to all docs-related repos. That way, we can also minimize the length of the Contributing Guidelines.

## Suggest Solution

- Move the &quot;Using Markdown for This Project&quot; section to the Contributing Guidelines in OpenSauced Docs.
- Change the title to &quot;Markdown Style Guide&quot;.
- Adjust the content, if necessary, to be applicable to all repos.
- Link the Markdown guide from the Docs in the Contributing Guide of this repo with suggestion as below:

  ```markdown
  ## Markdown Style Guide

  Please follow our [Markdown Style Guide](&lt;link to the docs&gt;) for the Markdown convention that we use at OpenSauced when you contribute to this project.

Add a section of &quot;Screenshot&quot; after the &quot;Added to documentation?&quot; to the PR template.

It happens because there is no &quot;push&quot; command listed in the scripts.

### Suggestion

Add &quot;push&quot; to the &quot;scripts&quot; in the `package.json`.

1. Run `npm run push` command to commit changes.

As I am using Windows 11, the solution to add the `linebreak-style` rule configuration for Windows in this thread works. I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:

```bash
rules {
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;],
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;],
}
```

However, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. 

### Alternative Solution

Adding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.

And here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.


## Steps to reproduce

On VS Code in the Windows machine:

1. Open any TypeScript file.
2. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on panel bar.
3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.

      <td>## Description

Outside of Hacktoberfest, most contributors who contribute to this repo are participants of our Intro to Open Source course. So I propose to remove the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Update Branch & Resolve Conflicts&quot; sections and move them to the Intro to Open Source course. 

Moving these sections to the course will give 2 benefits:

1. As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.
2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course. That way, it can attracts folks to check out our course and potentially, recommend the course to others.

## Propose Solution

- Move the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) section from README to replace the content in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section in the course.
- Move the [Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#keeping-branch-up-to-date-and-resolving-merge-conflicts) from README to replace the [Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=merge-conflicts) section in the course.
- Link each section from &quot;Intro to Open Source&quot; course to the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and the &quot;Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts&quot; section in the README.

4. Click the card to see the back side of the dev card — can't see the &quot;View Profile&quot; button.
5. Hover over — can see most of the card, but the &quot;View Profile&quot; button is cut off.

I found out through @nickytonline stream that we can go back by clicking the &quot;Repos&quot; word.

### Suggestion

Perhaps having a button with the text &quot;back&quot; or adding/showing an underline (like a link) at &quot;Repos&quot; text to indicate that it's clickable would help.

1. Go to the Lists page.

      <td>## Description

There are things that can be improved in the README as follows:

1. Fix wordings.

   - OpenSauced has several websites. And currently, in the Getting Started section, we have a link to the Intro to OSS website with text &quot;opensauced&quot; (with no capital letters).
   - In the [Building Your Open Source Resume](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#building-your-open-source-resume) section, there's a suggestion to read the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section in chapter 6. However, there is no section with this title. Instead, there is a [Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume) section.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Currently, there are 5 chapters mentioned in this section. But we have 6 chapters now, including [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) .

3. There is no link to our i18n guidelines in the [🤝 Contributing to this Repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-to-this-repository) section.

## Suggestion

1. Fix wordings

   - Change the link text of the website to &quot;Intro to Open Source course&quot; to clarify the target website.

     ```markdown
     ... visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/) website and start reading!
     ```
   - There are two options to update the title in the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section:
  
     1. Change &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; to &quot;Develop your Open Source Resume&quot; to match the course.
     2. Change the title in the course from &quot;[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)&quot; to &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot;.

     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.

It would make more sense if it becomes a section rather than a standalone chapter.
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter will be suitable to hold this section.

## Suggestion

Move this section into the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter, right after [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section.
This would also be in line with the suggestion in issue #81.</td>

### Improving README and i18n Guidelines

There are also opportunities for enhancement by reorganizing and updating the docs as follow:

- Update and organize the README.
- Move &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; from README to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organize the i18n Guidelines.

You can add your resource to one of the suitable files in the [`resources`](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/tree/main/resources) folder.

If you don't find any folder that is suitable for your resource:

- Create a new markdown file in the `resources` folder. For example, `job-hunting.md`.
- Use the format in [this `supportive-tech-orgs.md` file](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/resources/supportive-tech-orgs.md) to add your resource.</td>

- Add an `h2` with text: Table of Contents.
- Remove the first `&lt;li&gt;` (SheSharp Knowledge Hub) as we don't need to navigate to it from the Table of Content.

As our monthly challenges are evolving, we need to update our documentation for the Monthly Challenge Team to accomodate the changes. It will be very helpful for new volunteers to onboard themselves when we have updated documentation.

## Suggestions

Let's gradually improving the docs for Monthly Challenge Team as we go and when we know the structure for every challenge.

We can update the docs we have now (and rename the files accordingly). Or we can create a new file for each challenge, and archive the old one in a folder once the challenge is updated.

## To Do

### General Docs

- [x] Create how to update monthly challenge page on the website docs.
- [x] Update `leader-docs.md`.

### Update VC Challenges (in no particular order)

- [x] Hacktoberfest
- [x] Month of Learning
- [x] Get Job Ready
- [x] Creative Community Challenge
- [x] Blogging Challenge
- [x] Preptember
- [x] Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
- [x] Build in Public
- [x] Community Kindness
- [x] Creating Audio/Visual content
- [x] Pairing
- [x] Month of Feedback
- [x] Mid-Year Check-In
- [x] New Year, New Goals (NEW!)

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>

The first paragraph in the section mentioned that we have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) that located in the `pizza-verse` repository. However, this section is more comprehensive than the style guide.

Currently, we only have this section in the &quot;Intro to OSS course&quot; and &quot;Maintainer Intro Course&quot; repos. But there is a potential that we will refer this section to contributors who work on docs across repos.

We might want to consider having this in one place — the &quot;[Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)&quot; section in the Docs might be suitable for it — and link it to all docs-related repos. That way, we can also minimize the length of the Contributing Guidelines.

## Suggest Solution

- Move the &quot;Using Markdown for This Project&quot; section to the Contributing Guidelines in OpenSauced Docs.
- Change the title to &quot;Markdown Style Guide&quot;.
- Adjust the content, if necessary, to be applicable to all repos.
- Link the Markdown guide from the Docs in the Contributing Guide of this repo with suggestion as below:

  ```markdown
  ## Markdown Style Guide

  Please follow our [Markdown Style Guide](&lt;link to the docs&gt;) for the Markdown convention that we use at OpenSauced when you contribute to this project.

Add a section of &quot;Screenshot&quot; after the &quot;Added to documentation?&quot; to the PR template.

It happens because there is no &quot;push&quot; command listed in the scripts.

### Suggestion

Add &quot;push&quot; to the &quot;scripts&quot; in the `package.json`.

After running `git add .`:

1. Run `npm run push` command to commit changes.
2.  You will get the error of `Missing script: &quot;push&quot;`.

      <td>## Describe the bug

When I worked on the `constants.ts` file, I get lots error messages: `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'`.
And this error happens in all TypeScript files.

### Screenshot

![Lint error](https://github.com/open-sauced/ai/assets/45172775/86f97741-2f81-43fd-b580-02e872a9b86a)

## Suggestion

After did some research, I found [the same problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37826449/expected-linebreaks-to-be-lf-but-found-crlf-linebreak-style), and it happens only for Windows users.

As I am using Windows 11, the solution to add the `linebreak-style` rule configuration for Windows in this thread works. I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:

```bash
rules {
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;],
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;],
}
```

However, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. 

### Alternative Solution

Adding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.

And here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.


## Steps to reproduce

On VS Code in the Windows machine:

1. Open any TypeScript file.
2. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on panel bar.
3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.

      <td>## Description

Outside of Hacktoberfest, most contributors who contribute to this repo are participants of our Intro to Open Source course. So I propose to remove the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Update Branch & Resolve Conflicts&quot; sections and move them to the Intro to Open Source course. 

Moving these sections to the course will give 2 benefits:

1. As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.
2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course. That way, it can attracts folks to check out our course and potentially, recommend the course to others.

## Propose Solution

- Move the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) section from README to replace the content in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section in the course.
- Move the [Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#keeping-branch-up-to-date-and-resolving-merge-conflicts) from README to replace the [Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=merge-conflicts) section in the course.
- Link each section from &quot;Intro to Open Source&quot; course to the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and the &quot;Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts&quot; section in the README.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to a [user's card page](https://app.opensauced.pizza/user/adiati98/card).
2. Look at the front side of the dev card — can't see the text under the numbers.
3. Hover over — and still can't see the text under the numbers.
4. Click the card to see the back side of the dev card — can't see the &quot;View Profile&quot; button.
5. Hover over — can see most of the card, but the &quot;View Profile&quot; button is cut off.

After clicking a repo's graph in the &quot;Activity&quot; tab in the Lists Page, I can't go back to the previous graphs. I need to refresh the page to do so.

![OpenSauced Lists Refresh](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/8f698232-8cba-4ce3-ac0b-a1471e1ecfed)

### Note

I found out through @nickytonline stream that we can go back by clicking the &quot;Repos&quot; word.
But I think this would be confusing for users as there is no indication that they should click the &quot;Repos&quot; to go back.

### Suggestion

Perhaps having a button with the text &quot;back&quot; or adding/showing an underline (like a link) at &quot;Repos&quot; text to indicate that it's clickable would help.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the Lists page.
2. Click any list.
3. Click &quot;Activity&quot; tab.
4. Click one of the repo stats on the right.
5. How to get back to the previous stats with all the repo?

      <td>## Description

There are things that can be improved in the README as follows:

1. Fix wordings.

   - OpenSauced has several websites. And currently, in the Getting Started section, we have a link to the Intro to OSS website with text &quot;opensauced&quot; (with no capital letters).
   - In the [Building Your Open Source Resume](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#building-your-open-source-resume) section, there's a suggestion to read the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section in chapter 6. However, there is no section with this title. Instead, there is a [Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume) section.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Currently, there are 5 chapters mentioned in this section. But we have 6 chapters now, including [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) .

3. There is no link to our i18n guidelines in the [🤝 Contributing to this Repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-to-this-repository) section.

## Suggestion

1. Fix wordings

   - Change the link text of the website to &quot;Intro to Open Source course&quot; to clarify the target website.

     ```markdown
     ... visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/) website and start reading!
     ```
   - There are two options to update the title in the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section:
  
     1. Change &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; to &quot;Develop your Open Source Resume&quot; to match the course.
     2. Change the title in the course from &quot;[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)&quot; to &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot;.

     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.

3. Add a link to i18n Guidelines for translation.</td>

      <td>## Description

The chapter [Understanding Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/11-understanding-merge-conflicts) currently lives at the end of the intro course, right after &quot;Glossary&quot;.
It would make more sense if it becomes a section rather than a standalone chapter.
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter will be suitable to hold this section.

## Suggestion

Move this section into the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter, right after [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section.

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `app &gt; routes &gt; newsletter &gt; issues` and create a new file `2023-11.jsx`.

### Improving README and i18n Guidelines

There are also opportunities for enhancement by reorganizing and updating the docs as follow:

- Update and organize the README.
- Move &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; from README to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organize the i18n Guidelines.

- Fix things that need to be fix here.
- Reorganize and improve the README and i18n guidelines for more clarity.</td>

If you don't find any folder that is suitable for your resource:

- Create a new markdown file in the `resources` folder. For example, `job-hunting.md`.
- Use the format in [this `supportive-tech-orgs.md` file](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/resources/supportive-tech-orgs.md) to add your resource.</td>

## Description

There is a Table of Content in the README file, however, it's quite all over the place without a title.

Having a title for the Table of Content and make it a section will make the README tidier.

&lt;!-- Help us understand why you think this suggestion is valuable. How would it benefit the project or community? --&gt;

## Implementation (if applicable)

- Add an `h2` with text: Table of Contents.
- Remove the first `&lt;li&gt;` (SheSharp Knowledge Hub) as we don't need to navigate to it from the Table of Content.

It happens because the files have been removed. They also reflected [on the website](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/).

- The &quot;[Conclusion](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-conclusion)&quot; page on the website also redirect to 404. This happens because the file changed from `07-conclusion.md` to `09-conclusion.md`.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to [conclusion](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-conclusion) or [additional resources](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/08-additional-resources) or [glossary](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/09-glossary) page on the website.
2. You will see a &quot;404 - Not found&quot;.

      <td>## Motivation

As our monthly challenges are evolving, we need to update our documentation for the Monthly Challenge Team to accomodate the changes. It will be very helpful for new volunteers to onboard themselves when we have updated documentation.

## Suggestions

Let's gradually improving the docs for Monthly Challenge Team as we go and when we know the structure for every challenge.

We can update the docs we have now (and rename the files accordingly). Or we can create a new file for each challenge, and archive the old one in a folder once the challenge is updated.

## To Do

### General Docs

- [x] Create how to update monthly challenge page on the website docs.
- [x] Update `leader-docs.md`.

### Update VC Challenges (in no particular order)

- [x] Hacktoberfest
- [x] Month of Learning
- [x] Get Job Ready
- [x] Creative Community Challenge
- [x] Blogging Challenge
- [x] Preptember
- [x] Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
- [x] Build in Public
- [x] Community Kindness
- [x] Creating Audio/Visual content
- [x] Pairing
- [x] Month of Feedback
- [x] Mid-Year Check-In
- [x] New Year, New Goals (NEW!)

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over &quot;by hand.&quot;

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `app &gt; routes &gt; newsletter &gt; issues` and create a new file `2023-10.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `app &gt; routes &gt; newsletter &gt; issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in [Newsletters section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.

When I wanted to give a reaction to a highlight, the icon shuts down right away (in milliseconds) every time I click it.

Below is the screen recording. It's hard to capture the state of the icon closing right away, so you might see as if nothing happens when clicking the icon button.

      <td>## Background

The &quot;[Using Markdown for This Project](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-markdown-for-this-project)&quot; section contains the Markdown convention we use at OpenSauced.

The first paragraph in the section mentioned that we have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) that located in the `pizza-verse` repository. However, this section is more comprehensive than the style guide.

Currently, we only have this section in the &quot;Intro to OSS course&quot; and &quot;Maintainer Intro Course&quot; repos. But there is a potential that we will refer this section to contributors who work on docs across repos.

We might want to consider having this in one place — the &quot;[Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)&quot; section in the Docs might be suitable for it — and link it to all docs-related repos. That way, we can also minimize the length of the Contributing Guidelines.

## Suggest Solution

- Move the &quot;Using Markdown for This Project&quot; section to the Contributing Guidelines in OpenSauced Docs.
- Change the title to &quot;Markdown Style Guide&quot;.
- Adjust the content, if necessary, to be applicable to all repos.
- Link the Markdown guide from the Docs in the Contributing Guide of this repo with suggestion as below:

  ```markdown
  ## Markdown Style Guide

  Please follow our [Markdown Style Guide](&lt;link to the docs&gt;) for the Markdown convention that we use at OpenSauced when you contribute to this project.

When I worked on the `constants.ts` file, I get lots error messages: `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'`.

### Screenshot

![Lint error](https://github.com/open-sauced/ai/assets/45172775/86f97741-2f81-43fd-b580-02e872a9b86a)

## Suggestion

After did some research, I found [the same problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37826449/expected-linebreaks-to-be-lf-but-found-crlf-linebreak-style), and it happens only for Windows users.

As I am using Windows 11, the solution to add the `linebreak-style` rule configuration for Windows in this thread works. I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:

```bash
rules {
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;],
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;],
}
```

However, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. 

### Alternative Solution

Adding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.

And here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.


## Steps to reproduce

On VS Code in the Windows machine:

1. Open any TypeScript file.
2. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on panel bar.
3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.

1. As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.
2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course. That way, it can attracts folks to check out our course and potentially, recommend the course to others.

## Propose Solution

- Move the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) section from README to replace the content in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section in the course.
- Move the [Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#keeping-branch-up-to-date-and-resolving-merge-conflicts) from README to replace the [Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=merge-conflicts) section in the course.
- Link each section from &quot;Intro to Open Source&quot; course to the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and the &quot;Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts&quot; section in the README. 

## Note

This issue is depending on [this PR in the intro repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/pull/100).</td>

I wanted to generate a PR description using the Chrome extention. But I couldn't find the OpenSauced orange button anywhere in the PR form like shown in the [instruction GIF on the docs](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/tools/chrome-extension/pr-description/).

After manually fill in the form and submitted the PR, the orange button to &quot;add PR to highlights&quot; appeared as per screenshot provided below.

I'm using Windows 11.

When previewing the dev card in the [Card page](https://app.opensauced.pizza/user/adiati98/card), the dev card is cut off at the bottom so user can't see the whole card.

### Front side

**Default state**: User cannot see the text under the numbers. This can be confusing.
**Hover state**: User still cannot see the text under the numbers.

### Back side

**Default state**: User cannot see the &quot;View Profile&quot; button.

### Note

I found out through @nickytonline stream that we can go back by clicking the &quot;Repos&quot; word.
But I think this would be confusing for users as there is no indication that they should click the &quot;Repos&quot; to go back.

### Suggestion

Perhaps having a button with the text &quot;back&quot; or adding/showing an underline (like a link) at &quot;Repos&quot; text to indicate that it's clickable would help.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the Lists page.
2. Click any list.
3. Click &quot;Activity&quot; tab.
4. Click one of the repo stats on the right.
5. How to get back to the previous stats with all the repo?

      <td>## Description

There are things that can be improved in the README as follows:

1. Fix wordings.

   - OpenSauced has several websites. And currently, in the Getting Started section, we have a link to the Intro to OSS website with text &quot;opensauced&quot; (with no capital letters).
   - In the [Building Your Open Source Resume](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#building-your-open-source-resume) section, there's a suggestion to read the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section in chapter 6. However, there is no section with this title. Instead, there is a [Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume) section.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Currently, there are 5 chapters mentioned in this section. But we have 6 chapters now, including [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) .

3. There is no link to our i18n guidelines in the [🤝 Contributing to this Repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-to-this-repository) section.

## Suggestion

1. Fix wordings

   - Change the link text of the website to &quot;Intro to Open Source course&quot; to clarify the target website.

     ```markdown
     ... visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/) website and start reading!
     ```
   - There are two options to update the title in the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section:
  
     1. Change &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; to &quot;Develop your Open Source Resume&quot; to match the course.
     2. Change the title in the course from &quot;[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)&quot; to &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot;.

     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.

3. Add a link to i18n Guidelines for translation.</td>

The chapter [Understanding Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/11-understanding-merge-conflicts) currently lives at the end of the intro course, right after &quot;Glossary&quot;.
It would make more sense if it becomes a section rather than a standalone chapter.
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter will be suitable to hold this section.

## Suggestion

Move this section into the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter, right after [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section.

### Improving README and i18n Guidelines

There are also opportunities for enhancement by reorganizing and updating the docs as follow:

- Update and organize the README.
- Move &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; from README to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organize the i18n Guidelines.

- Mobile & Desktop Screenshots/Recordings
- Added tests?
- [optional] Are there any post-deployment tasks we need to perform?

### Suggested solution

Based on the default template, create a PR template in the `.github` folder with related contents for this repo:

- Remove the sections that are mentioned above.
- Include only necessary items in the &quot;What type of PR is this?&quot; section as follow:
  - ☝️ Add a pizza fact or trivia
  - 🧑‍🍳 Add a pizza recipe
  - 🗺️ Add a regional pizza
  - 📝 Documentation Update
 - Include only necessary items in the &quot;Added to documentation?&quot; section as follow:
    - 📜 README.md
    - 🙅 no documentation needed

We are collecting valuable resources that can help our community.
So, if you have good resources you want to add here, we welcome them! ✨

Our resources cover different areas, from tech-related, such as software development, data analysis, product management, and quality assurance, to the general ones that can help others, such as housing in The Netherlands, supportive tech organizations, etc.

⚠️ **To maintain the quality of resources that we are gathering here, we accept no more than 2 resources per contributor**.

## How to Add a Resource

You can add your resource to one of the suitable files in the [`resources`](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/tree/main/resources) folder.

If you don't find any folder that is suitable for your resource:

- Create a new markdown file in the `resources` folder. For example, `job-hunting.md`.
- Use the format in [this `supportive-tech-orgs.md` file](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/resources/supportive-tech-orgs.md) to add your resource.</td>

Currently, in the step 7 of the Getting Started section we have this:

```markdown
7. If you used the CLI tool method in step 6, to add yourself to the guestbook, ...

It should be step &quot;5&quot; instead of &quot;6&quot;.

🌟 Hi there! We're excited to hear your suggestions and ideas for making this project better. Thank you for contributing to our community!

## Description

There is a Table of Content in the README file, however, it's quite all over the place without a title.

&lt;!-- Describe your suggestion or improvement in a few sentences. What would you like to see added, changed, or enhanced? --&gt;

## Motivation

Having a title for the Table of Content and make it a section will make the README tidier.

&lt;!-- Help us understand why you think this suggestion is valuable. How would it benefit the project or community? --&gt;

## Implementation (if applicable)

- Add an `h2` with text: Table of Contents.
- Remove the first `&lt;li&gt;` (SheSharp Knowledge Hub) as we don't need to navigate to it from the Table of Content.

&lt;!-- If you have specific ideas on how this suggestion could be implemented, share them here. Code snippets, screenshots, or any additional context are welcome! --&gt;

The process of adding contributors to this repository gives high potential of resolving conflicts before PR can be merged. It happens because new contributors will always add themselves at the end of the contributors array.

- Add a section in the README to walk through the process of resolving merge conflicts.

      <td>## Motivation

As our monthly challenges are evolving, we need to update our documentation for the Monthly Challenge Team to accomodate the changes. It will be very helpful for new volunteers to onboard themselves when we have updated documentation.

## Suggestions

Let's gradually improving the docs for Monthly Challenge Team as we go and when we know the structure for every challenge.

We can update the docs we have now (and rename the files accordingly). Or we can create a new file for each challenge, and archive the old one in a folder once the challenge is updated.

## To Do

### General Docs

- [x] Create how to update monthly challenge page on the website docs.
- [x] Update `leader-docs.md`.

### Update VC Challenges (in no particular order)

- [x] Hacktoberfest
- [x] Month of Learning
- [x] Get Job Ready
- [x] Creative Community Challenge
- [x] Blogging Challenge
- [x] Preptember
- [x] Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
- [x] Build in Public
- [x] Community Kindness
- [x] Creating Audio/Visual content
- [x] Pairing
- [x] Month of Feedback
- [x] Mid-Year Check-In
- [x] New Year, New Goals (NEW!)

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>

The &quot;[Using Markdown for This Project](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-markdown-for-this-project)&quot; section contains the Markdown convention we use at OpenSauced.

The first paragraph in the section mentioned that we have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) that located in the `pizza-verse` repository. However, this section is more comprehensive than the style guide.

Currently, we only have this section in the &quot;Intro to OSS course&quot; and &quot;Maintainer Intro Course&quot; repos. But there is a potential that we will refer this section to contributors who work on docs across repos.

We might want to consider having this in one place — the &quot;[Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)&quot; section in the Docs might be suitable for it — and link it to all docs-related repos. That way, we can also minimize the length of the Contributing Guidelines.

## Suggest Solution

- Move the &quot;Using Markdown for This Project&quot; section to the Contributing Guidelines in OpenSauced Docs.
- Change the title to &quot;Markdown Style Guide&quot;.
- Adjust the content, if necessary, to be applicable to all repos.
- Link the Markdown guide from the Docs in the Contributing Guide of this repo with suggestion as below:

  ```markdown

Certain parts of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in this repository follows the one (https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the `intro` repository. This can create confusion amongst contributors.

## Propose Solution

In the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, omit the following:

The &quot;How to Contribute to Open Source&quot; section has a list of topics that contain the titles of the sections and subsections. But we don't need this because we have a sidebar that holds these titles and serves as a Table of Contents.

## Propose Solution

Remove the list in the [How to Contribute to Open Source](http://localhost:3000/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=how-to-contribute-to-open-source) section.

We received a handfull of PRs that missed the step of generating profile and badge on the README.

## Proposed Solution

Add a section of &quot;Screenshot&quot; after the &quot;Added to documentation?&quot; to the PR template. There will be an explanation here that contributors need to provide a screenshot of their profile being generated on README. This will ease maintainers in reviewing PRs and ensure contributors to run the generate command.  </td>

It happens because there is no &quot;push&quot; command listed in the scripts.

### Suggestion

Add &quot;push&quot; to the &quot;scripts&quot; in the `package.json`.

### Steps to reproduce

After running `git add .`:

1. Run `npm run push` command to commit changes.
2.  You will get the error of `Missing script: &quot;push&quot;`.

      <td>## Describe the bug

When I worked on the `constants.ts` file, I get lots error messages: `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'`.
And this error happens in all TypeScript files.

### Screenshot

![Lint error](https://github.com/open-sauced/ai/assets/45172775/86f97741-2f81-43fd-b580-02e872a9b86a)

## Suggestion

After did some research, I found [the same problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37826449/expected-linebreaks-to-be-lf-but-found-crlf-linebreak-style), and it happens only for Windows users.

As I am using Windows 11, the solution to add the `linebreak-style` rule configuration for Windows in this thread works. I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:

```bash
rules {
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;],
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;],
}
```

However, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. 

### Alternative Solution

Adding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.

And here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.


## Steps to reproduce

On VS Code in the Windows machine:

1. Open any TypeScript file.
2. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on panel bar.
3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.

      <td>## Description

Outside of Hacktoberfest, most contributors who contribute to this repo are participants of our Intro to Open Source course. So I propose to remove the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Update Branch & Resolve Conflicts&quot; sections and move them to the Intro to Open Source course. 

Moving these sections to the course will give 2 benefits:

1. As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.
2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course. That way, it can attracts folks to check out our course and potentially, recommend the course to others.

## Propose Solution

- Move the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) section from README to replace the content in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section in the course.
- Move the [Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#keeping-branch-up-to-date-and-resolving-merge-conflicts) from README to replace the [Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=merge-conflicts) section in the course.

Perhaps having a button with the text &quot;back&quot; or adding/showing an underline (like a link) at &quot;Repos&quot; text to indicate that it's clickable would help.

Update the content in the [Formatting Your Highlight](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/06-the-secret-sauce.md#formatting-your-highlight) based on the current way to add Highlights.

      <td>## Description

There are things that can be improved in the README as follows:

1. Fix wordings.

   - OpenSauced has several websites. And currently, in the Getting Started section, we have a link to the Intro to OSS website with text &quot;opensauced&quot; (with no capital letters).
   - In the [Building Your Open Source Resume](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#building-your-open-source-resume) section, there's a suggestion to read the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section in chapter 6. However, there is no section with this title. Instead, there is a [Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume) section.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Currently, there are 5 chapters mentioned in this section. But we have 6 chapters now, including [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) .

3. There is no link to our i18n guidelines in the [🤝 Contributing to this Repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-to-this-repository) section.

## Suggestion

1. Fix wordings

   - Change the link text of the website to &quot;Intro to Open Source course&quot; to clarify the target website.

     ```markdown
     ... visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/) website and start reading!
     ```
   - There are two options to update the title in the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section:
  
     1. Change &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; to &quot;Develop your Open Source Resume&quot; to match the course.
     2. Change the title in the course from &quot;[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)&quot; to &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot;.

     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.

3. Add a link to i18n Guidelines for translation.</td>

      <td>## Description

The chapter [Understanding Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/11-understanding-merge-conflicts) currently lives at the end of the intro course, right after &quot;Glossary&quot;.
It would make more sense if it becomes a section rather than a standalone chapter.
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter will be suitable to hold this section.

## Suggestion

Move this section into the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter, right after [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section.

### Improving README and i18n Guidelines

There are also opportunities for enhancement by reorganizing and updating the docs as follow:

- Update and organize the README.
- Move &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; from README to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organize the i18n Guidelines.

We are collecting valuable resources that can help our community.
So, if you have good resources you want to add here, we welcome them! ✨

Our resources cover different areas, from tech-related, such as software development, data analysis, product management, and quality assurance, to the general ones that can help others, such as housing in The Netherlands, supportive tech organizations, etc.

⚠️ **To maintain the quality of resources that we are gathering here, we accept no more than 2 resources per contributor**.

## How to Add a Resource

You can add your resource to one of the suitable files in the [`resources`](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/tree/main/resources) folder.

If you don't find any folder that is suitable for your resource:

- Create a new markdown file in the `resources` folder. For example, `job-hunting.md`.
- Use the format in [this `supportive-tech-orgs.md` file](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/resources/supportive-tech-orgs.md) to add your resource.</td>

As our monthly challenges are evolving, we need to update our documentation for the Monthly Challenge Team to accomodate the changes. It will be very helpful for new volunteers to onboard themselves when we have updated documentation.

## Suggestions

Let's gradually improving the docs for Monthly Challenge Team as we go and when we know the structure for every challenge.

We can update the docs we have now (and rename the files accordingly). Or we can create a new file for each challenge, and archive the old one in a folder once the challenge is updated.

## To Do

### General Docs

- [x] Create how to update monthly challenge page on the website docs.
- [x] Update `leader-docs.md`.

### Update VC Challenges (in no particular order)

- [x] Hacktoberfest
- [x] Month of Learning
- [x] Get Job Ready
- [x] Creative Community Challenge
- [x] Blogging Challenge
- [x] Preptember
- [x] Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
- [x] Build in Public
- [x] Community Kindness
- [x] Creating Audio/Visual content
- [x] Pairing
- [x] Month of Feedback
- [x] Mid-Year Check-In
- [x] New Year, New Goals (NEW!)

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>

      <td>## Describe the bug

When I worked on the `Party.tsx` file, I got 75 error messages of &quot;Delete `CR` eslint(prettier/prettier)&quot;. I'm on Windows machine, so this error probably only affect Windows users.

1. Open VS Code in Windows machine.
2. Open any `.tsx` file.
3. You will see lots of red warnings in the file.
5. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on the panel bar.
6. You will see the details of the error: &quot;Delete `CR` eslint(prettier/prettier)&quot;.

## Expected behavior

This error should not occur.

      <td>### Describe the bug

When I wanted to give a reaction to a highlight, the icon shuts down right away (in milliseconds) every time I click it.

Below is the screen recording. It's hard to capture the state of the icon closing right away, so you might see as if nothing happens when clicking the icon button.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Click the bell icon on the top bar of your OpenSauced dashboard to open the notifications.
2. Click on a user's highlight. You will see the highlight's card.
3. Click the smiley button to give reaction to the highlight.
4. The icons will close immediately.

      <td>## Background

The &quot;[Using Markdown for This Project](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-markdown-for-this-project)&quot; section contains the Markdown convention we use at OpenSauced.

The first paragraph in the section mentioned that we have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) that located in the `pizza-verse` repository. However, this section is more comprehensive than the style guide.

Currently, we only have this section in the &quot;Intro to OSS course&quot; and &quot;Maintainer Intro Course&quot; repos. But there is a potential that we will refer this section to contributors who work on docs across repos.

We might want to consider having this in one place — the &quot;[Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)&quot; section in the Docs might be suitable for it — and link it to all docs-related repos. That way, we can also minimize the length of the Contributing Guidelines.

## Suggest Solution

- Move the &quot;Using Markdown for This Project&quot; section to the Contributing Guidelines in OpenSauced Docs.
- Change the title to &quot;Markdown Style Guide&quot;.
- Adjust the content, if necessary, to be applicable to all repos.
- Link the Markdown guide from the Docs in the Contributing Guide of this repo with suggestion as below:

  ```markdown
  ## Markdown Style Guide

  Please follow our [Markdown Style Guide](&lt;link to the docs&gt;) for the Markdown convention that we use at OpenSauced when you contribute to this project.

It happens because there is no &quot;push&quot; command listed in the scripts.

### Suggestion

Add &quot;push&quot; to the &quot;scripts&quot; in the `package.json`.

After running `git add .`:

1. Run `npm run push` command to commit changes.
2.  You will get the error of `Missing script: &quot;push&quot;`.

      <td>## Describe the bug

When I worked on the `constants.ts` file, I get lots error messages: `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'`.
And this error happens in all TypeScript files.

### Screenshot

![Lint error](https://github.com/open-sauced/ai/assets/45172775/86f97741-2f81-43fd-b580-02e872a9b86a)

## Suggestion

After did some research, I found [the same problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37826449/expected-linebreaks-to-be-lf-but-found-crlf-linebreak-style), and it happens only for Windows users.

As I am using Windows 11, the solution to add the `linebreak-style` rule configuration for Windows in this thread works. I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:

```bash
rules {
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;],
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;],
}
```

However, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. 

### Alternative Solution

Adding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.

And here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.


## Steps to reproduce

On VS Code in the Windows machine:

1. Open any TypeScript file.
2. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on panel bar.
3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.

      <td>## Description

Outside of Hacktoberfest, most contributors who contribute to this repo are participants of our Intro to Open Source course. So I propose to remove the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Update Branch & Resolve Conflicts&quot; sections and move them to the Intro to Open Source course. 

Moving these sections to the course will give 2 benefits:

1. As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.
2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course. That way, it can attracts folks to check out our course and potentially, recommend the course to others.

## Propose Solution

- Move the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) section from README to replace the content in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section in the course.
- Move the [Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#keeping-branch-up-to-date-and-resolving-merge-conflicts) from README to replace the [Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=merge-conflicts) section in the course.
- Link each section from &quot;Intro to Open Source&quot; course to the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and the &quot;Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts&quot; section in the README.

I'm not sure if this is similar with issue #477.

 When I wanted to sign in to Hot OpenSauced, it redirected me to confirm authorization and I accepted it.
But instead of getting signed in, it sent me back to the page where I needed to sign in again.
Clicking the sign in button doesn't signing me in to the website although I see the access token in the bar.

When previewing the dev card in the [Card page](https://app.opensauced.pizza/user/adiati98/card), the dev card is cut off at the bottom so user can't see the whole card.

## Issues

### Front side

**Default state**: User cannot see the text under the numbers. This can be confusing.
**Hover state**: User still cannot see the text under the numbers.

### Back side

**Default state**: User cannot see the &quot;View Profile&quot; button.
**Hover state**: The &quot;View Profile&quot; button is cut off.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to a [user's card page](https://app.opensauced.pizza/user/adiati98/card).
2. Look at the front side of the dev card — can't see the text under the numbers.
3. Hover over — and still can't see the text under the numbers.
4. Click the card to see the back side of the dev card — can't see the &quot;View Profile&quot; button.
5. Hover over — can see most of the card, but the &quot;View Profile&quot; button is cut off.

### Note

I found out through @nickytonline stream that we can go back by clicking the &quot;Repos&quot; word.
But I think this would be confusing for users as there is no indication that they should click the &quot;Repos&quot; to go back.

### Suggestion

Perhaps having a button with the text &quot;back&quot; or adding/showing an underline (like a link) at &quot;Repos&quot; text to indicate that it's clickable would help.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the Lists page.
2. Click any list.
3. Click &quot;Activity&quot; tab.
4. Click one of the repo stats on the right.
5. How to get back to the previous stats with all the repo?

      <td>## Description

There are things that can be improved in the README as follows:

1. Fix wordings.

   - OpenSauced has several websites. And currently, in the Getting Started section, we have a link to the Intro to OSS website with text &quot;opensauced&quot; (with no capital letters).
   - In the [Building Your Open Source Resume](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#building-your-open-source-resume) section, there's a suggestion to read the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section in chapter 6. However, there is no section with this title. Instead, there is a [Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume) section.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Currently, there are 5 chapters mentioned in this section. But we have 6 chapters now, including [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) .

3. There is no link to our i18n guidelines in the [🤝 Contributing to this Repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-to-this-repository) section.

## Suggestion

1. Fix wordings

   - Change the link text of the website to &quot;Intro to Open Source course&quot; to clarify the target website.

     ```markdown
     ... visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/) website and start reading!
     ```
   - There are two options to update the title in the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section:
  
     1. Change &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; to &quot;Develop your Open Source Resume&quot; to match the course.
     2. Change the title in the course from &quot;[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)&quot; to &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot;.

     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.

3. Add a link to i18n Guidelines for translation.</td>

      <td>## Description

The chapter [Understanding Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/11-understanding-merge-conflicts) currently lives at the end of the intro course, right after &quot;Glossary&quot;.
It would make more sense if it becomes a section rather than a standalone chapter.
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter will be suitable to hold this section.

## Suggestion

Move this section into the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter, right after [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section.

### Improving README and i18n Guidelines

There are also opportunities for enhancement by reorganizing and updating the docs as follow:

- Update and organize the README.
- Move &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; from README to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organize the i18n Guidelines.

``` 

It should be step &quot;5&quot; instead of &quot;6&quot;.

This can be misleading, so we need to fix it.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook#getting-started) section.
2. See step no. 7

      <td># Suggestion/Improvement

🌟 Hi there! We're excited to hear your suggestions and ideas for making this project better. Thank you for contributing to our community!

## Description

There is a Table of Content in the README file, however, it's quite all over the place without a title.

![SheSharp TOC](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/assets/45172775/a3fe549a-a2f2-4582-89ce-9896e0e4f503)

&lt;!-- Describe your suggestion or improvement in a few sentences. What would you like to see added, changed, or enhanced? --&gt;

## Motivation

Having a title for the Table of Content and make it a section will make the README tidier.

&lt;!-- Help us understand why you think this suggestion is valuable. How would it benefit the project or community? --&gt;

## Implementation (if applicable)

- Add an `h2` with text: Table of Contents.
- Remove the first `&lt;li&gt;` (SheSharp Knowledge Hub) as we don't need to navigate to it from the Table of Content.

&lt;!-- If you have specific ideas on how this suggestion could be implemented, share them here. Code snippets, screenshots, or any additional context are welcome! --&gt;

&lt;!--
## Your Participation Matters

We appreciate your efforts to make this project more awesome! Your suggestions are valuable to us, and we'll review them as soon as possible.

🍕 Feature

### Current behavior

The process of adding contributors to this repository gives high potential of resolving conflicts before PR can be merged. It happens because new contributors will always add themselves at the end of the contributors array.

### Suggested solution

- Add a section in the README to walk through the process of resolving merge conflicts.
- Add screeshots/screen recordings (GIF)/video walkthrough for better understanding.

- The &quot;[Conclusion](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-conclusion)&quot; page on the website also redirect to 404. This happens because the file changed from `07-conclusion.md` to `09-conclusion.md`.

      <td>## Motivation

As our monthly challenges are evolving, we need to update our documentation for the Monthly Challenge Team to accomodate the changes. It will be very helpful for new volunteers to onboard themselves when we have updated documentation.

## Suggestions

Let's gradually improving the docs for Monthly Challenge Team as we go and when we know the structure for every challenge.

We can update the docs we have now (and rename the files accordingly). Or we can create a new file for each challenge, and archive the old one in a folder once the challenge is updated.

## To Do

### General Docs

- [x] Create how to update monthly challenge page on the website docs.
- [x] Update `leader-docs.md`.

### Update VC Challenges (in no particular order)

- [x] Hacktoberfest
- [x] Month of Learning
- [x] Get Job Ready
- [x] Creative Community Challenge
- [x] Blogging Challenge
- [x] Preptember
- [x] Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
- [x] Build in Public
- [x] Community Kindness
- [x] Creating Audio/Visual content
- [x] Pairing
- [x] Month of Feedback
- [x] Mid-Year Check-In
- [x] New Year, New Goals (NEW!)

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>

When I wanted to give a reaction to a highlight, the icon shuts down right away (in milliseconds) every time I click it.

Below is the screen recording. It's hard to capture the state of the icon closing right away, so you might see as if nothing happens when clicking the icon button.

      <td>## Background

The &quot;[Using Markdown for This Project](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-markdown-for-this-project)&quot; section contains the Markdown convention we use at OpenSauced.

The first paragraph in the section mentioned that we have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) that located in the `pizza-verse` repository. However, this section is more comprehensive than the style guide.

Currently, we only have this section in the &quot;Intro to OSS course&quot; and &quot;Maintainer Intro Course&quot; repos. But there is a potential that we will refer this section to contributors who work on docs across repos.

We might want to consider having this in one place — the &quot;[Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)&quot; section in the Docs might be suitable for it — and link it to all docs-related repos. That way, we can also minimize the length of the Contributing Guidelines.

## Suggest Solution

- Move the &quot;Using Markdown for This Project&quot; section to the Contributing Guidelines in OpenSauced Docs.
- Change the title to &quot;Markdown Style Guide&quot;.
- Adjust the content, if necessary, to be applicable to all repos.
- Link the Markdown guide from the Docs in the Contributing Guide of this repo with suggestion as below:

  ```markdown
  ## Markdown Style Guide

  Please follow our [Markdown Style Guide](&lt;link to the docs&gt;) for the Markdown convention that we use at OpenSauced when you contribute to this project.

After did some research, I found [the same problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37826449/expected-linebreaks-to-be-lf-but-found-crlf-linebreak-style), and it happens only for Windows users.

As I am using Windows 11, the solution to add the `linebreak-style` rule configuration for Windows in this thread works. I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:

```bash
rules {
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;],
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;],
}
```

However, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. 

### Alternative Solution

Adding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.

And here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.


## Steps to reproduce

On VS Code in the Windows machine:

1. Open any TypeScript file.
2. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on panel bar.
3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.

      <td>## Description

Outside of Hacktoberfest, most contributors who contribute to this repo are participants of our Intro to Open Source course. So I propose to remove the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Update Branch & Resolve Conflicts&quot; sections and move them to the Intro to Open Source course. 

Moving these sections to the course will give 2 benefits:

1. As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.
2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course. That way, it can attracts folks to check out our course and potentially, recommend the course to others.

## Propose Solution

- Move the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) section from README to replace the content in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section in the course.
- Move the [Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#keeping-branch-up-to-date-and-resolving-merge-conflicts) from README to replace the [Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=merge-conflicts) section in the course.
- Link each section from &quot;Intro to Open Source&quot; course to the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and the &quot;Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts&quot; section in the README.

4. Click the card to see the back side of the dev card — can't see the &quot;View Profile&quot; button.
5. Hover over — can see most of the card, but the &quot;View Profile&quot; button is cut off.

I found out through @nickytonline stream that we can go back by clicking the &quot;Repos&quot; word.
But I think this would be confusing for users as there is no indication that they should click the &quot;Repos&quot; to go back.

Perhaps having a button with the text &quot;back&quot; or adding/showing an underline (like a link) at &quot;Repos&quot; text to indicate that it's clickable would help.

1. Go to the Lists page.

      <td>## Description

There are things that can be improved in the README as follows:

1. Fix wordings.

   - OpenSauced has several websites. And currently, in the Getting Started section, we have a link to the Intro to OSS website with text &quot;opensauced&quot; (with no capital letters).
   - In the [Building Your Open Source Resume](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#building-your-open-source-resume) section, there's a suggestion to read the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section in chapter 6. However, there is no section with this title. Instead, there is a [Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume) section.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Currently, there are 5 chapters mentioned in this section. But we have 6 chapters now, including [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) .

3. There is no link to our i18n guidelines in the [🤝 Contributing to this Repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-to-this-repository) section.

## Suggestion

1. Fix wordings

   - Change the link text of the website to &quot;Intro to Open Source course&quot; to clarify the target website.

     ```markdown
     ... visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/) website and start reading!
     ```
   - There are two options to update the title in the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section:
  
     1. Change &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; to &quot;Develop your Open Source Resume&quot; to match the course.
     2. Change the title in the course from &quot;[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)&quot; to &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot;.

     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.

3. Add a link to i18n Guidelines for translation.</td>

      <td>## Description

The chapter [Understanding Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/11-understanding-merge-conflicts) currently lives at the end of the intro course, right after &quot;Glossary&quot;.
It would make more sense if it becomes a section rather than a standalone chapter.
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter will be suitable to hold this section.

## Suggestion

Move this section into the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter, right after [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section.
This would also be in line with the suggestion in issue #81.</td>

You can add your resource to one of the suitable files in the [`resources`](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/tree/main/resources) folder.

If you don't find any folder that is suitable for your resource:

- Create a new markdown file in the `resources` folder. For example, `job-hunting.md`.
- Use the format in [this `supportive-tech-orgs.md` file](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/resources/supportive-tech-orgs.md) to add your resource.</td>

## Implementation (if applicable)

- Add an `h2` with text: Table of Contents.
- Remove the first `&lt;li&gt;` (SheSharp Knowledge Hub) as we don't need to navigate to it from the Table of Content.

As our monthly challenges are evolving, we need to update our documentation for the Monthly Challenge Team to accomodate the changes. It will be very helpful for new volunteers to onboard themselves when we have updated documentation.

## Suggestions

Let's gradually improving the docs for Monthly Challenge Team as we go and when we know the structure for every challenge.

We can update the docs we have now (and rename the files accordingly). Or we can create a new file for each challenge, and archive the old one in a folder once the challenge is updated.

## To Do

### General Docs

- [x] Create how to update monthly challenge page on the website docs.
- [x] Update `leader-docs.md`.

### Update VC Challenges (in no particular order)

- [x] Hacktoberfest
- [x] Month of Learning
- [x] Get Job Ready
- [x] Creative Community Challenge
- [x] Blogging Challenge
- [x] Preptember
- [x] Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
- [x] Build in Public
- [x] Community Kindness
- [x] Creating Audio/Visual content
- [x] Pairing
- [x] Month of Feedback
- [x] Mid-Year Check-In
- [x] New Year, New Goals (NEW!)

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>

The &quot;[Using Markdown for This Project](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-markdown-for-this-project)&quot; section contains the Markdown convention we use at OpenSauced.

The first paragraph in the section mentioned that we have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) that located in the `pizza-verse` repository. However, this section is more comprehensive than the style guide.

Currently, we only have this section in the &quot;Intro to OSS course&quot; and &quot;Maintainer Intro Course&quot; repos. But there is a potential that we will refer this section to contributors who work on docs across repos.

We might want to consider having this in one place — the &quot;[Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/)&quot; section in the Docs might be suitable for it — and link it to all docs-related repos. That way, we can also minimize the length of the Contributing Guidelines.

## Suggest Solution

- Move the &quot;Using Markdown for This Project&quot; section to the Contributing Guidelines in OpenSauced Docs.
- Change the title to &quot;Markdown Style Guide&quot;.
- Adjust the content, if necessary, to be applicable to all repos.
- Link the Markdown guide from the Docs in the Contributing Guide of this repo with suggestion as below:

  ```markdown
  ## Markdown Style Guide

  Please follow our [Markdown Style Guide](&lt;link to the docs&gt;) for the Markdown convention that we use at OpenSauced when you contribute to this project.

Add a section of &quot;Screenshot&quot; after the &quot;Added to documentation?&quot; to the PR template.

It happens because there is no &quot;push&quot; command listed in the scripts.

### Suggestion

Add &quot;push&quot; to the &quot;scripts&quot; in the `package.json`.

After running `git add .`:

1. Run `npm run push` command to commit changes.

      <td>## Describe the bug

When I worked on the `constants.ts` file, I get lots error messages: `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'`.
And this error happens in all TypeScript files.

### Screenshot

![Lint error](https://github.com/open-sauced/ai/assets/45172775/86f97741-2f81-43fd-b580-02e872a9b86a)

## Suggestion

After did some research, I found [the same problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37826449/expected-linebreaks-to-be-lf-but-found-crlf-linebreak-style), and it happens only for Windows users.

As I am using Windows 11, the solution to add the `linebreak-style` rule configuration for Windows in this thread works. I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:

```bash
rules {
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;],
  &quot;linebreak-style&quot;: [&quot;error&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;],
}
```

However, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. 

### Alternative Solution

Adding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.

And here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.


## Steps to reproduce

On VS Code in the Windows machine:

1. Open any TypeScript file.
2. Click &quot;PROBLEMS&quot; tab on panel bar.
3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.

      <td>## Description

Outside of Hacktoberfest, most contributors who contribute to this repo are participants of our Intro to Open Source course. So I propose to remove the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Update Branch & Resolve Conflicts&quot; sections and move them to the Intro to Open Source course. 

Moving these sections to the course will give 2 benefits:

1. As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.
2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course. That way, it can attracts folks to check out our course and potentially, recommend the course to others.

## Propose Solution

- Move the [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) section from README to replace the content in the [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section in the course.
- Move the [Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook?tab=readme-ov-file#keeping-branch-up-to-date-and-resolving-merge-conflicts) from README to replace the [Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=merge-conflicts) section in the course.
- Link each section from &quot;Intro to Open Source&quot; course to the &quot;Getting Started&quot; and the &quot;Keeping Branch Up to Date and Resolving Merge Conflicts&quot; section in the README.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to a [user's card page](https://app.opensauced.pizza/user/adiati98/card).
2. Look at the front side of the dev card — can't see the text under the numbers.
3. Hover over — and still can't see the text under the numbers.
4. Click the card to see the back side of the dev card — can't see the &quot;View Profile&quot; button.
5. Hover over — can see most of the card, but the &quot;View Profile&quot; button is cut off.

After clicking a repo's graph in the &quot;Activity&quot; tab in the Lists Page, I can't go back to the previous graphs. I need to refresh the page to do so.

### Note

I found out through @nickytonline stream that we can go back by clicking the &quot;Repos&quot; word.
But I think this would be confusing for users as there is no indication that they should click the &quot;Repos&quot; to go back.

### Suggestion

Perhaps having a button with the text &quot;back&quot; or adding/showing an underline (like a link) at &quot;Repos&quot; text to indicate that it's clickable would help.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the Lists page.
2. Click any list.
3. Click &quot;Activity&quot; tab.
4. Click one of the repo stats on the right.
5. How to get back to the previous stats with all the repo?

      <td>## Description

There are things that can be improved in the README as follows:

1. Fix wordings.

   - OpenSauced has several websites. And currently, in the Getting Started section, we have a link to the Intro to OSS website with text &quot;opensauced&quot; (with no capital letters).
   - In the [Building Your Open Source Resume](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#building-your-open-source-resume) section, there's a suggestion to read the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section in chapter 6. However, there is no section with this title. Instead, there is a [Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume) section.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Currently, there are 5 chapters mentioned in this section. But we have 6 chapters now, including [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) .

3. There is no link to our i18n guidelines in the [🤝 Contributing to this Repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#-contributing-to-this-repository) section.

## Suggestion

1. Fix wordings

   - Change the link text of the website to &quot;Intro to Open Source course&quot; to clarify the target website.

     ```markdown
     ... visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/) website and start reading!
     ```
   - There are two options to update the title in the &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; section:
  
     1. Change &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot; to &quot;Develop your Open Source Resume&quot; to match the course.
     2. Change the title in the course from &quot;[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)&quot; to &quot;Building Your Open Source Resume&quot;.

     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.

2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.

   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.

3. Add a link to i18n Guidelines for translation.</td>

      <td>## Description

The chapter [Understanding Merge Conflicts](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/11-understanding-merge-conflicts) currently lives at the end of the intro course, right after &quot;Glossary&quot;.
It would make more sense if it becomes a section rather than a standalone chapter.
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter will be suitable to hold this section.

## Suggestion

Move this section into the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source) chapter, right after [Let's Get Practical](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source?id=let39s-get-practical) section.

### Improving README and i18n Guidelines

There are also opportunities for enhancement by reorganizing and updating the docs as follow:

- Update and organize the README.
- Move &quot;Adding Translations to Documentation&quot; from README to `i18n-guidelines.md`.
- Organize the i18n Guidelines.

- Fix things that need to be fix here.
- Reorganize and improve the README and i18n guidelines for more clarity.</td>

## Suggestion

If you don't find any folder that is suitable for your resource:

- Create a new markdown file in the `resources` folder. For example, `job-hunting.md`.
- Use the format in [this `supportive-tech-orgs.md` file](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/resources/supportive-tech-orgs.md) to add your resource.</td>

## Description

There is a Table of Content in the README file, however, it's quite all over the place without a title.

Having a title for the Table of Content and make it a section will make the README tidier.

&lt;!-- Help us understand why you think this suggestion is valuable. How would it benefit the project or community? --&gt;

## Implementation (if applicable)

- Add an `h2` with text: Table of Contents.
- Remove the first `&lt;li&gt;` (SheSharp Knowledge Hub) as we don't need to navigate to it from the Table of Content.

&lt;!-- If you have specific ideas on how this suggestion could be implemented, share them here. Code snippets, screenshots, or any additional context are welcome! --&gt;

- The link to [Glossary](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/09-glossary.md) and [Additional Resources](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/08-additional-resources.md) files in the &quot;[Additional Information](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro#additional-information)&quot; section on the README are leading to 404. It happens because the files have been removed. They also reflected [on the website](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/).

- The &quot;[Conclusion](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-conclusion)&quot; page on the website also redirect to 404. This happens because the file changed from `07-conclusion.md` to `09-conclusion.md`.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to [conclusion](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-conclusion) or [additional resources](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/08-additional-resources) or [glossary](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/09-glossary) page on the website.
2. You will see a &quot;404 - Not found&quot;.

      <td><a href='https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/issues/324'>docs: Improve Monthly Challenge Team Documentation</a></td>
      <td>## Motivation

As our monthly challenges are evolving, we need to update our documentation for the Monthly Challenge Team to accomodate the changes. It will be very helpful for new volunteers to onboard themselves when we have updated documentation.

## Suggestions

Let's gradually improving the docs for Monthly Challenge Team as we go and when we know the structure for every challenge.

We can update the docs we have now (and rename the files accordingly). Or we can create a new file for each challenge, and archive the old one in a folder once the challenge is updated.

## To Do

### General Docs

- [x] Create how to update monthly challenge page on the website docs.
- [x] Update `leader-docs.md`.

### Update VC Challenges (in no particular order)

- [x] Hacktoberfest
- [x] Month of Learning
- [x] Get Job Ready
- [x] Creative Community Challenge
- [x] Blogging Challenge
- [x] Preptember
- [x] Healthy Habits for Happy Devs
- [x] Build in Public
- [x] Community Kindness
- [x] Creating Audio/Visual content
- [x] Pairing
- [x] Month of Feedback
- [x] Mid-Year Check-In
- [x] New Year, New Goals (NEW!)

### Contents for every challenge

Every monthly challenge will have following contents:

- What to prepare for the challenge — blog post, repo, VC members only site (like Hacktoberfest Initiative and Blogging challenge), etc.
- Wordings for async check-ins on Slack — this can be adjusted for every challenge. But we might want to document the adjustments as our record.</td>

      <td>## Issue Context

Every month, we try to get the newsletter up on the site within a week of emailing it. Currently, we're moving them over &quot;by hand.&quot;

## Steps to update

In the code base, navigate to `app &gt; routes &gt; newsletter &gt; issues` and create a new file `2023-10.jsx`.
You can look at the existing newsletters ( `app &gt; routes &gt; newsletter &gt; issues`) as a template.

Make sure to add it to the index by following the steps in [Newsletters section in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io#newsletters) and update the content accordingly based on our email newsletter.
