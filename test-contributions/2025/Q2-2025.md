        <td>## Description<br><br>The `maintainermonth` repo currently doesn&#39;t have a `CODEOWNERS` file. Having this file would benefits both maintainers and contributors with the below reasons:<br><br>- Whenever there&#39;s an issue or PR coming in, maintainers will get notified. That way, all issues and PRs can get attention they need and hardly get missed.<br><br>- Contributors don&#39;t always know who maintain a repo. In some cases, when there are active/regular contributors, folks are assuming that they are the maintainer of the repo. Maintainers are decision makers who understand the vision and mission of the repo. So it makes more sense to tag the maintainers team when they have questions or ask directions that needs to be aligned with the project&#39;s needs. We can then mention this in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` that when folks need to reach out maintainers, they can tag `@github/team-name`.<br><br>## Suggestions<br><br>Add a `CODEOWNERS` file to the `.github` folder.<br><br>---<br><br>&gt;[!NOTE]<br>&gt; If this is a go, I believe this issue would best be handled by the maintainers team of `maintainermonth` repo.</td>

It doesn&#39;t make sense to have two copies that are constantly out of sync when we&#39;ve implemented Docusaurus.<br><br>### Proposed solution<br><br>## Simple Fix Solution<br><br>Since @adiati98 has put in all that amazing work of getting the VC Community Docs site online, I think we should start linking to it heavily from our vc.io site.<br><br>### Pros<br><br>- Much of the content in the vc.io website is already documented in the VC Community Docs site, so we&#39;ll instantly gain a value boost<br>- In regard to updates going forward, there will be an immediate reduction of labor while providing the equivalent or enhanced content outcomes<br>- Retains an organized structure and allows for increased discoverability<br><br>### Cons<br><br>- Navigating between vc.io and the VC Community Docs site isn&#39;t intuitive nor user-friendly as they are very much still separate entities<br>- There will be a lift at the very beginning to ensure no information is lost in the deduping process<br><br>## The More Involved One<br><br>We can create [MDX partials](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown) and dynamically import sections or even whole pages into each site from a central location. This would require vc.io and the VC Community Docs to co-exist within a [monorepo folder structure](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#monorepos).<br><br>### Pros<br><br>- The monorepo architecture is something we can take care of as Maintainers/Documentation Lead and need not concern our open-source contributors<br>- There will be **one definitive place** to update content that would otherwise be duplicated across both the vc.io website and the VC Community Docs site<br><br>### Cons<br><br>- The monorepo folder structure will take some configuring behind the scenes<br>- Save any fancy git-fu, there would be yet one more repo to keep track of<br><br><br>### Resources that can help<br><br>_No response_<br><br>### Collaborators<br><br>@adiati98 @danieltott @BekahHW <br><br>### Code of Conduct<br><br>- [x] I&#39;ve read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community</td>

Visit the documentation<br>2. Look for sign-up/login instructions<br>3. See the reference to a &quot;Connect with GitHub&quot; button<br><br><br>### Expected behavior<br>The documentation should reflect that sign-up and GitHub login are no longer available and maybe point users toward current community efforts if any.<br><br><br>### Additional context<br>I’m new to open source but would love to help fix this if someone could point me to the right place in the documentation.<br><br>Thanks!  <br>Osarugue<br><br><br><br><br></td>
