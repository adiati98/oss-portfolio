        <td># Suggestion/Improvement<br><br>## Description<br><br>I would like to suggest the creation of a new &quot;Open Source&quot; page in our knowledge hub repository. This page aims to provide valuable resources and guidance for individuals looking to get started with open source or enhance their contributions to existing projects. The content will cover various aspects, from finding your first open-source project to effectively communicating with project maintainers.<br><br>## Motivation<br><br>Open source is a crucial aspect of the tech community, fostering collaboration and skill development. By creating a dedicated &quot;Open Source&quot; page, we aim to centralize resources and insights to make it easier for individuals, especially those new to open source, to navigate and contribute effectively. <br><br>The page will empower users with actionable items and guide them through the process of becoming active contributors.<br><br>Moreover, this page represents an **opportunity for our community members to showcase their expertise and insights**. We encourage community members to contribute tech content they created, such as blog posts, videos, and other valuable resources, which will be featured in the respective sections of the &quot;Open Source&quot; page. This not only enhances the richness of the page but also provides a platform for community members to share their experiences and knowledge with a broader audience.<br><br>## Implementation<br><br>The &quot;Open Source&quot; page will consist of different sections, each focusing on specific intents, goals, and actionable items for readers. In addition, each section will incorporate links to related articles, videos, and tech content created by SheSharp&#39;s community, offering a rich and diverse set of resources. <br><br>This could be a section:<br><br>###  Find An Open-Source Project<br><br>This section can feature:<br>- Tips on choosing a project aligned with personal interests and skill level<br>- Curated list of beginner-friendly projects across different technologies<br>- Links to related articles and videos by SheSharp&#39;s community members sharing their tips<br><br>These are just examples to give an idea.<br><br>Feel free to provide feedback and additional suggestions for sections and content.<br></td>
