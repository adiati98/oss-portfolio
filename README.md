# Open Source Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio of my open-source contributions.

My goal for creating this log is to keep a detailed, organized record of my work, from pull requests and bug reports to general collaborations. It's a way for me to track my journey and share my contributions with the community.

The content in this repository is generated automatically using a GitHub Action. I plan to add more details in the future.
