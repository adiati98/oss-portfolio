      "description": "## Description\n\nI forked and cloned the `maintainermonth` repository on my local machine.\n\nI followed the instructions on the `README` to run the project locally. However, I encountered some problems when installing dependencies with `yarn`.\n\n### Environment\n\n- **OS:** Windows 11\n- **Yarn version:** v1.22.19\n- **Node version:** v20.17.0\n\n## How to reproduce the bug\n\n### `yarn install`\n\n1. Fork and clone the forked `maintainermonth` repository to your local machine.\n2. Run `yarn install`.\n3. You will get an error message (the path will be different depending on your directory & folder names):\n\n    ```bash\n    error An unexpected error occurred: \"Unknown token: { line: 1379, col: 1, type: 'INVALID', value: undefined } 1379:1 in D:\\\\WebDev\\\\GitHub\\\\maintainermonth\\\\yarn.lock\".\n    ```\n\n### `yarn start`\n\nWhen I could finally install the dependencies, running `yarn start` also gave me a problem.\n\n1. Run `yarn start`.\n2. You will get an error message (the path will be different depending on your directory & folder names):\n\n    ```bash\n    Error: Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory. Try building your app with 'next build' before starting the production server. https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/production-start-no-build-id\n    at setupFsCheck (D:\\WebDev\\GitHub\\maintainermonth\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\lib\\router-utils\\filesystem.js:151:19)\n    at async initialize (D:\\WebDev\\GitHub\\maintainermonth\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\lib\\router-server.js:63:23)\n    at async Server.<anonymous> (D:\\WebDev\\GitHub\\maintainermonth\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\lib\\start-server.js:249:36)\n    error Command failed with exit code 1.\n    ```\n\n### `yarn build`\n\nAfter running `yarn start`, in the error message, it was mentioned: `Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory. Try building your app with 'next build' before starting the production server.`\n\nSo, I followed this instruction as the below:\n\n1. Run `yarn build`.\n2. You will get the error message:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ NODE_ENV=production next build\n    'NODE_ENV' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n    error Command failed with exit code 1.\n    ```\n\n## Workaround\n\nI finally could get everything worked as expected with the below workaround:\n\n1. Fork and clone the forked `maintainermonth` repository to the local machine.\n2. Remove the `yarn.lock` file.\n3. Run `yarn install`.\n    \n    > Now the dependencies can be installed without any issue, and a new `yarn.lock` file is generated.\n4. Run `yarn dev`.\n    \n    > Running `yarn start` still doesn't work. But `yarn dev` runs and renders the website with no problem.\n\n## Suggestions\n\nSometimes, Windows users encounter problems that Mac users don't. It'd be great if other Windows users could confirm if this also happened in their machine.\n\nIf they encounter the same problem, we might want to update the instructions on the README to accommodate Windows users.\n\nThings to consider:\n\n- Run `yarn dev` instead of `yarn start`\n- Recommended `yarn` version if preferable\n- Recommended Node version if preferable",

Having this file would benefits both maintainers and contributors with the below reasons:\n\n- Whenever there's an issue or PR coming in, maintainers will get notified. That way, all issues and PRs can get attention they need and hardly get missed.\n\n- Contributors don't always know who maintain a repo. In some cases, when there are active/regular contributors, folks are assuming that they are the maintainer of the repo. Maintainers are decision makers who understand the vision and mission of the repo. So it makes more sense to tag the maintainers team when they have questions or ask directions that needs to be aligned with the project's needs. We can then mention this in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` that when folks need to reach out maintainers, they can tag `@github/team-name`.\n\n## Suggestions\n\nAdd a `CODEOWNERS` file to the `.github` folder.\n\n---\n\n>[!NOTE]\n> If this is a go, I believe this issue would best be handled by the maintainers team of `maintainermonth` repo.",

      "description": "### Suggested solution\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nAs I'm trying to find a way to create a base for our community translations, it gave me a thought.\r\n\r\nSo far, I don't see any open source project that has contributing & translation guidelines chapters on their live website. Usually, they have either:\r\n\r\n   - \"Edit this page on GH\" that bring folks to the page file on GH, or\r\n   - Link to the repo on GH.\r\n\r\n   But we do have [contributing guidelines](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/CONTRIBUTING) and [translations guidelines](http://localhost:3000/#/i18n-guidelines) live on our website. I think it makes more sense if these files live _only_ in the repo.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, I propose to move `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `i18n-guidelines.md` to the root. We will still link these on the homepage of the course.\r\n\r\n### Alternative\r\n\r\nIf we want to be a bit more organized, we can follow GH docs repo. They have a [contributing folder](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/contributing) that contains various contributing guidelines. So we can create a `contributing` folder at the root and move the guidelines files into this folder.\r\n\r\n## Community Translations\r\n\r\nIn the forked repo of translations, they will have these in their root:\r\n\r\n- Translated `CONTRIBUTING.md`.\r\n- Translated `i18n-guidelines.md`.\r\n- A contributing file that contains guidelines to contribute to the forked repo.\r\n\r\n   They can name it anything, but preferably consistent across forked repos for documentation matter. So, maybe something like: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-LANG.md` and change the `LANG` to the translated languange. For example: `CONTRIBUTING-TO-ES.md`. They can link this file in the README on the root. This file can be upper- or lower-case. It doesn't matter as there is no convention for this. However, we want this to be consistent across forked repos.\r\n\r\n",

So, every time we toggle and open the sidebar from the \"Explore\" or \"Highlights\" tab and click the \"Home\" icon, we were redirected to the last workspace that we opened.\r\n\r\nNow, clicking the \"Home\" icon will bring users to their personal workspace instead. We don't see the sidebar toggle on \"Explore\" and \"Highlight\" tabs anymore.\r\nClicking the OpenSauced logo or \"Workspace\" tab takes us to personal wokspace instead of the last workpace that we opened.\r\n\r\nSo, when we select a workspace, then navigate to another tab and get back to the \"Workspace\" tab, we will land in the personal workspace.

Good news is I still can access them. But I found something new instead.\r\n\r\n### The Bug\r\n\r\n- Logged out user can open the sidebar and see the list of repo and contributor insights, even the private ones.\r\n- When logged out user click \"show all\" at Repository Insights on the sidebar, it will redirect them to the Repository Insights page, but no page is shown.\r\n- When logged out user click \"show all\" at Contributor Insights on the sidebar, it will redirect them to the Contributor Insights page, and all public and private pages are shown.\r\n- Logged out user is able to click the \"bin\" icon. They will be prompted with a message to type the name of the page. They can click the \"Delete\" button, however it won't delete the page as they're not signing in.\r\n- Logged out user is able to click the create new repo or contributor insights page and fill the data. But they are unable to create a new page. The warning of \"You must be logged in to create a page\" appears.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behaviour \r\n\r\nWhen a logged out user open the shared link, they shouldn't be able to see the insights pages, especially the private ones, even on the sidebar.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there is an intention for someone who doesn't have account on OpenSauced to have a taste of creating a new page. However, they shouldn't be able to see the list of insights pages.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the sidebar can't be seen on shared pages.\r\n\r\n### Screen Recording\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n![insights pages on sidebar](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/134825e9-1a4b-42a6-8f4f-9efa54885abd)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-01 142230](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/a0f72479-c4b0-46a1-bc61-525d40f35738)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-01 142439](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/32f8b090-7182-405f-836a-e958416b5ffd)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-01 142103](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/8b1ccdc2-06f8-4637-8d29-06766646a392)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-01 130240](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/assets/45172775/5512ae9d-f38d-45c0-87ae-c916a274b1e0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIn the state of logged out:\r\n\r\n1. Go to a public shared insight page. You can use this link: https://app.opensauced.pizza/pages/BekahHW/1055/dashboard that shared by @BekahHW on docs.\r\n   It will redirect you to the new path of workspace.\r\n3. Click the sidebar.\r\n4. You will see the list of the user's insights page.\r\n5. Click \"show all\" for the Contributor Insights.\r\n6. You will see the list of public and private pages.\r\n7. You can click each of the page to open it and see the insights.\r\n8. You can even click the \"bin\" icon. It will give you the prompt to type the name of the page to delete the page. However, clicking it won't delete the page as you're logged out. (I don't want to try this when I'm signing in, so I don't know how it behaves if the user is signing in).\r\n9. Open the sidebar. \r\n10. Click the \"+\" and select create repo or contributor insights page.\r\n11. Fill in the areas.\r\n12. Click the \"Create page\" button.\r\n13.

That way, they don't have to comment on the PR, and it also helps you by preventing them from adding non-maintainers — such as regular contributors — as reviewers.\r\n\r\n   This paragraph sounds quite confusing and hard to follow.\r\n\r\n2. > - **Branch protection**\r\n   >\r\n   >   If you opt-in to \"Require approval\" and \"Require review from Code Owners\" to protect a branch, a certain number of code owners must approve any pull request before the pull request can be merged into the protected branch.\r\n\r\n   We can add a little bit reason why maintainers want to protect a branch.\r\n\r\n3. Intro paragraph can be adjusted for clarity.\r\n4. We want to have consistency with the word _pull request_.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n\r\n1. Change all \"PR\" word to \"pull request\" in the file.\r\n2. Fix the wording with something as follow:\r\n\r\n   > - **Prevent contributors from manually adding reviewers**\r\n   >\r\n   >    When a pull request comes from external contributors, _code owners prevents them from manually adding reviewers because it automatically adds the reviewers. That way, contributors don't have to comment and tag anyone on the comment to review their pull request. It also helps you to stop them from adding non-maintainers — such as regular contributors — as reviewers._\r\n\r\n   > - **Branch protection**\r\n   >\r\n   >   If you opt-in to \"Require approval\" and \"Require review from Code Owners\" to protect a branch, a certain number of code owners must approve any pull request before it can be merged into the protected branch. _This can reduce the chance of merging pull requests that can break the production_.\r\n\r\n3. Adjust the intro with something like:\r\n\r\n   > Most of the time, contributors don't know the maintainers of a project, so they don't know who to add as reviewers. When they create a PR, _they usually leave a comment without tagging anyone, like, \"Can you please review my PR?\" Without being tagged,_ maintainers don't get notified about this new PR and comment, causing it to be missed from the radar. Adding the CODEOWNERS file to the repository will help you to automate and tackle this issue.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

I don't get these error messages anymore. Below is the code I tried to apply in the `eslintrc.js`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrules {\r\n  \"linebreak-style\": [\"error\", \"unix\"],\r\n  \"linebreak-style\": [\"error\", \"windows\"],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure if this would be a good solution. \r\n\r\n### Alternative Solution\r\n\r\nAdding a line in a `.gitattributes` file as mentioned in the [official eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/linebreak-style#using-this-rule-with-version-control-systems) to make it easy for developers to contribute to the codebase from different platforms.\r\n\r\nAnd here is [another resources](https://dev.to/deadlybyte/please-add-gitattributes-to-your-git-repository-1jld) for adding a `.gitattributes` file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn VS Code in the Windows machine:\r\n\r\n1. Open any TypeScript file.\r\n2. Click \"PROBLEMS\" tab on panel bar.\r\n3. You will see lots of `error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'` messages.\r\n\r\n## Browsers\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n## Additional context (Is this in dev or production?)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n## Contributing Docs\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Contribution Docs",

As a one-stop-place of all course's docs for our participants.\r\n2. When folks who don't take the course come to this repo, they would be sent to our course.

Change \"Building Your Open Source Resume\" to \"Develop your Open Source Resume\" to match the course.\r\n     2. Change the title in the course from \"[Develop your Open Source Resume](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/06-the-secret-sauce?id=develop-your-open-source-resume)\" to \"Building Your Open Source Resume\".\r\n\r\n     After updating, link the section instead of linking the chapter 6.\r\n\r\n2. Update [Course Overview](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/README.md#course-overview) section.\r\n\r\n   Add the [Types of contributions](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/07-types-of-contributions) chapter.\r\n\r\n3.

      "description": "## Description\r\n\r\nThere are rooms for documentation improvement here. The aim is to give clear explanations and instructions for contributors, especially those who are new to open source.\r\nRight now, the README is a bit challenging to navigate for people who come to this repository for the first time. And there are also essential things missing in this repository.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\n### Add a license\r\n\r\nWithout a license, this repository is automatically licensed under \"All Rights Reserved\" which means that no one may use, modify, or redistribute anything in the project unless the owner gives them permission to do so.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\nAdd a `LICENSE` file to this repo and link the license in its section on the README. [This website](https://www.tldrlegal.com/) is very helpful in explaining software licenses in plain English. [MIT License](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) is one of licenses that's used most in open source.\r\n\r\n### Add a code of conduct\r\n\r\nHaving a code of conduct helps to maintain a safe and welcoming space for contributors. It will also help to moderate contributions and communication going on.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\nUse the community's code of conduct and put it in a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file. Or use [a template from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project#adding-a-code-of-conduct-using-a-template) to add one.\r\n\r\n### Change the title \"Suggesting a Resource\" to \"Contributing Guide\"\r\n\r\nThis section contains:\r\n- Inviting contributors to submit resources.\r\n- Navigate contributors to \"How to submit your suggestion\" — which contains the instructions to contribute.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\nHaving a straightforward title will give clarification about the section.\r\n\r\n### Replace the `knowledge-hub/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md` with `CONTRIBUTING.md` that will live in the root.\r\n\r\n`CONTRIBUTING.md` is a well-known file accross open-source projects that serves as a guide for contributors.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\nReplacing the `knowledge-hub/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md` with `CONTRIBUTING.md` will help SheSharp members to get familiar with the file and know where to find it in a repository when they contribute to other OSS projects.\r\n\r\nAlso mention here what type of resources that this project accepts for contributions.\r\n\r\n### Move the \"[Randstad Housing Resources](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#randstad-housing-resources)\" and \"[Organizations that help women and non-binary people break into tech](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#organizations-that-help-women-and-non-binary-people-break-into-tech)\" in the README to their own files.\r\n\r\nThere is the table of content in the README. However, it's confusing to see various things going on in the README.\r\n\r\nFor example, it's stated in the introduction:\r\n\r\n> The resources collected here cover different areas, such as software development, data analysis, product management and quality assurance.\r\n\r\nBut there are other resources outside what stated there.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion also comes from a consideration that potentially the list in the resources will get longer and SheSharp may add new resources type, for example, \"Job hunt resources\", \"Resources for moms in tech\", etc.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\nMove the resources to their own files and link these files on the README, but not having their content in the README.\r\n\r\n### [Social Media](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub#social-media) section\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\n- Adjust the title to \"SheSharp Members' Social Media\" or something like that to clarify that only the SheSharp members are on the list, except if this repository is accepting socials from outside of the community members.\r\n- Having the social media section (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub profiles, etc.) on the README is great. But when it's getting much longer, consider to move it to its own file.\r\n\r\n### How to communicate\r\n\r\nThere is this sentence in the contributing guide:\r\n\r\n> If you need any help, feel free to raise an issue.\r\n\r\nIt would be best to give this sentence more attention so contributors can find it quickly.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\nGive it a section on the README called \"Do You Have Questions?\" or \"Community\" or anything else that suits the needs.\r\n\r\nThis section will contain:\r\n- When contributors need help, have questions or ideas, where do they need to go? — Slack (and which channel), raise an issue, or using [Discussion board](https://github.com/features/discussions)?\r\n- Optional — if someone wants to contribute but not a SheSharp member, how to join SheSharp?\r\n\r\n### Is this repository receiving contributions from members only?\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\nIf this repo receives contributions from members only, make it clear by mentioning about it in the introduction on the README. Otherwise, state that everyone are encouraged to contribute.\r\n\r\n### Clarify the [Step by step](https://github.com/shesharpnl/knowledge-hub/blob/main/how-to/submit-your-suggestion.md#step-by-step) section.\r\n\r\nNot everybody knows the syntax on how to clone, create a new branch, commit, etc.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**:\r\n\r\nA clarification on how to do the actions would help beginners in open source to contribute to this repo.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways to do this:\r\n\r\n**Linking each step to a resource**. For example:\r\n\r\n3. [Create a branch](https://www.shellhacks.com/git-create-new-branch-and-checkout/) with a name that relates with your contribution.\r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\n**Manually write the instructions**. For example:\r\n\r\n3. Create a branch with a name that relates with your contribution.\r\n      Run this command in your terminal to create a new branch and navigate to it:\r\n  \r\n      ```bash\r\n      git checkout -b <branch-name>\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n      For example:\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      git checkout -b feat/add-ayu-linkedin\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

For example:\r\n\r\n3. Create a new branch for each day ...\r\n4. Create a new file and name it anything you like, e.g., `my-oss-journal.md`.

But I can't find information about the subscription, such as if I already subscribed, the subscription expiration date, billing information, etc. I also didn't get a confirmation email.\r\nI believe I have access to it because I don't see the \"Upgrade Access\" button on the \"User setting\" anymore.\r\n\r\nI also can't find information on whether the subscription is automatically extended and if paid users will get a notification when their subscription expires and choose to extend or terminate it. \n\n### Suggested solution\n\n- A dashboard about the paid user's subscription/plan. This may include billing information, subscription expiry date, and maybe a payment method (credit card with ending number — perhaps the user has multiple cards and needs clarification on which card they use — and the expiry date).\n\n- A confirmation email about the subscription. \r\n\r\n- Information (maybe at FAQ?) about:\r\n  - if users will get a notification before the subscription expires and whether they want to extend or cancel it.\r\n  - if the subscription is automatically extended or not. \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Contributing Docs\n\n- [ ] I agree to follow this project's Contribution Docs",

In this PR, Ayu and Fatima created two components for the feature(AddItem and ListItem). Ayu worked on the ListItem component and was able to read from firestore while Fatima worked on the AddItem component to write to firestore. The code was then refactored and clean up. We learnt how to work together and collaborate effectively, we also learnt how to debug and fix errors by googling and asking questions.\r\n\r\n### Write items to the database\r\nWe set up firestore on our codebase and connected it to the database so that we can write to it. We created a button and wrote a function for the button that helps submit our hard-coded data to firestore on a click action.\r\n\r\nCheck out more documentation and examples of how to write to firestore [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data)\r\n\r\n### Read items to the database\r\nWe set up firestore on our codebase and connected it to the database so that we can read from it.

      "url": "https://github.com/OpenSource-Communities/intro/pull/247",
      "repo": "OpenSource-Communities/intro",
      "description": "### Description:\r\nThis pull request addresses an issue with the `editUrl` configuration in the `docusaurus.config.js` file, where the `editUrl` was incorrectly concatenating the paths for editing the documentation. The issue was observed when the documentation structure was split into multiple subfolders, but the correct path was not reflected in the edit links.\r\n\r\n#### Problem:\r\nWhen attempting to edit documentation from the site, the generated edit URL was appending paths incorrectly. For example, it was redirecting users to:\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/README.md/docs/intro-to-oss/README.md\r\n```\r\nThis resulted in a broken link because of the duplicate path segments.\r\n\r\n#### Solution:\r\n1. **Dynamic Path Handling**: Updated the `editUrl` on line 47 of the `docusaurus.config.js` file to handle the subfolder structure dynamically. The `editUrl` now accurately reflects the path by properly concatenating the correct segments of the URL.\r\n   \r\n2. **Folder Structure**: The course documentation was split into two subfolders, which wasn't properly handled in the `editUrl` path. The issue has now been resolved by making the `editUrl` match the actual structure of the docs subfolder.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made:\r\n- Modified the `editUrl` on line 47 of the `docusaurus.config.js` to dynamically handle the subfolder structure.\r\n- Ensured that the URL correctly redirects to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository for the documentation:\r\n   ```\r\n   https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/docs/intro-to-oss/README.md\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Verification:\r\n- Verified that the changes work locally by testing the documentation edit links in the Docusaurus site. The edit links now correctly redirect to the respective documentation files in the GitHub repository.\r\n  \r\n### Affected Files:\r\n- `docusaurus.config.js`: Corrected the `editUrl` configuration to prevent path duplication and broken links.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues:\r\nClose #241 \r\n---",

It also removes outdated documentation about managing newsletters from the `README.md`. The key changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n### Monthly Challenges Page Updates\r\n\r\n* Marked \"Preptember\" as the current challenge by setting `current: true` and removed the `current: true` flag from the \"Photography Challenge\" to ensure only one challenge is marked as current at a time. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-64346fcf6132d142802ac41dab7b2b4817493c832a08e1115b118bb83aa65acfR290-R298) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-64346fcf6132d142802ac41dab7b2b4817493c832a08e1115b118bb83aa65acfL646)\r\n* Enhanced the \"Preptember\" challenge's subtitle and description to better explain its purpose and structure, emphasizing skill-building and preparation for Hacktoberfest.\r\n* Updated the link in the \"Preptember\" challenge details to point to the \"Fall 2025\" challenge page, and added a new link for \"September, 2024\" to the list of related links.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Cleanup and Update\r\n\r\n* Removed outdated instructions from the `README.md` regarding how to add and index newsletters, as this process is no longer relevant.\r\n* Added link to \"Monthly Challenge Technical Guidelines\" section for updating monthly challenge page.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nA pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.\r\n\r\nIt explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.\r\n\r\nA good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request. This helps not just the current maintainers but anyone reading it now or in the future to understand your intent.\r\n\r\nIf the request is not complete but you want feedback use  Draft Pull Request option of the Pull request dropdown menu.\r\n\r\n@mention individuals that you want to review the PR, and mention why.

That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.\r\n\r\nIf there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.\r\n\r\nA good \"Why\" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n> By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)\r\n",

You get the gist.\r\n\r\nA good description informs everyone that is reaading it of the purpose of the pull request.

It includes actionable steps, example prompts, and practical tips for job seekers.\r\n\r\n### New Resource Page: \"Navigating the Job Hunt with AI\"\r\n\r\n* **Page Metadata and Structure**:\r\n  - Added metadata (`title`, `description`, `hero`, and `order`) for the new page.\r\n  - Imported reusable components such as `LeadText`, `TextContainer`, and `Link` for consistent styling and layout.\r\n\r\n* **Content Highlights**:\r\n  - Introduced a step-by-step guide covering six key areas: defining job search context, building a portfolio, creating a social media plan, optimizing resumes, writing cover letters, and preparing for interviews. Each section includes actionable steps, example prompts, and example outputs.\r\n  - Added a \"Pro Tips for Success\" section with best practices for using AI effectively, such as providing context, iterating on drafts, and adding authenticity.\r\n  - Included a \"Quick Reference: High-Impact Prompts\" section summarizing key AI prompts for resumes,\r\n\r\n## Methodology\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nThis section explains why the above changes were made.\r\n\r\nSometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write \"Business/Product requirement\" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.\r\n\r\nIf there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.\r\n\r\nA good \"Why\" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n> By submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/)\r\n",

It doesn't make sense to have two copies that are constantly out of sync when we've implemented Docusaurus.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n## Simple Fix Solution\n\nSince @adiati98 has put in all that amazing work of getting the VC Community Docs site online, I think we should start linking to it heavily from our vc.io site.\n\n### Pros\n\n- Much of the content in the vc.io website is already documented in the VC Community Docs site, so we'll instantly gain a value boost\n- In regard to updates going forward, there will be an immediate reduction of labor while providing the equivalent or enhanced content outcomes\n- Retains an organized structure and allows for increased discoverability\n\n### Cons\n\n- Navigating between vc.io and the VC Community Docs site isn't intuitive nor user-friendly as they are very much still separate entities\n- There will be a lift at the very beginning to ensure no information is lost in the deduping process\n\n## The More Involved One\n\nWe can create [MDX partials](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown) and dynamically import sections or even whole pages into each site from a central location. This would require vc.io and the VC Community Docs to co-exist within a [monorepo folder structure](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#monorepos).\n\n### Pros\n\n- The monorepo architecture is something we can take care of as Maintainers/Documentation Lead and need not concern our open-source contributors\n- There will be **one definitive place** to update content that would otherwise be duplicated across both the vc.io website and the VC Community Docs site\n\n### Cons\n\n- The monorepo folder structure will take some configuring behind the scenes\n- Save any fancy git-fu, there would be yet one more repo to keep track of\n\n\n### Resources that can help\n\n_No response_\n\n### Collaborators\n\n@adiati98 @danieltott @BekahHW \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I've read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community",

Visit the documentation\n2. Look for sign-up/login instructions\n3. See the reference to a \"Connect with GitHub\" button\n\n\n### Expected behavior\nThe documentation should reflect that sign-up and GitHub login are no longer available and maybe point users toward current community efforts if any.\n\n\n### Additional context\nI’m new to open source but would love to help fix this if someone could point me to the right place in the documentation.\n\nThanks!  \nOsarugue\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Context for documentation change\n\nI've noticed inconsistent terminology throughout our documentation. This is certainly to be expected in projects with multiple contributors!\n\nFor example, one of our volunteer positions is referred to as: `notetaker`, `note taker`, and `note-taker` at varying points in this repository – and that's without taking capitalization into account. Another example is our how we refer to our Tuesday/Thursday Coffee meetings. It varies between `coffees`, `coffee chats`, `Tuesday/Thursday Coffees`, among other miscellaneous terms.\n\nWe should develop a style guide to pair with the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file as well as a glossary of terminology. I know there's currently a glossary on the website, but it may be more prudent to move it to this repo for ease of editing and discoverability.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nThis will be a bit of a larger lift overall, so I propose breaking it up into sub-issues.\n\n1. Go through the repo and make a list of terminology we'll need to standardize and include in the glossary. We can start the list from the linked discussion below.\n2. Replace each term with the standardized version. If we again stall on coming to a consensus, we should at least pick something and homogenize them so they'll be easier to replace later once a decision is made.\n3. Move the glossary from the website to this repo.\n\n### Resources that can help\n\nI started a discussion to [Revisit Our Naming Conventions for Volunteer Roles](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs/discussions/352), however, it grew stale quite quickly and hasn't resulted in any actionable decisions despite my attempts to revive it.\n\nThis is the [glossary](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/glossary) I referenced that's currently hosted on the website.\n\n### Collaborators\n\nI'll definitely need input from @adiati98 as Documentation Lead. I think @BekahHW will also want to weigh in on how we decide to standardize our documentation terminology. I'm going to tag @dominicduffin1, @tkshill, and @danieltott in case they have opinions to share.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I've read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community",

For each of those, we need to add `<!-- truncate -->` after the first or second paragraph. You should add it where it makes sense to cut off the text, giving the reader enough information to understand what the blog post is about and interested in reading more. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n\r\n> We've talked a lot about the challenges of being a maintainer, especially a solo maintainer. But like I say in our recent [newsletter](https://news.opensauced.pizza/why-open-source-is-a-team-sport/), open source is a team sport. But finding the right teammates can be a tricky situation as well. You might not get it right all of the time. And that's ok. Taking steps to make sure you and your project stay healthy can help to create a smoother and more rewarding open source experience. In this blog post, I'll provide a checklist and examples to help you build and manage an effective team for your open source project.\r\n>\r\n> `<!-- truncate -->`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This will generate a reference macro and a link file for you.\n\nFor internal linking check the docs on using the [:ref: role](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-ref-role) for linking within the same document, and using [:doc: to link across pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role).\n\n**Please note: if you see folders called .revs these are old version control files from Grav. Ignore them! (they should be deleted) and instead work on the actual files.**\n\nWhen you've converted the file/s, **they need to live within the /docs folder**.

Contributors using the CLI Tool method to submit their profile. \r\n2. Contributors are not running `npm run contributors:add`and `npm run contributors:generate`commands to generate their profile in the guestbook.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing this with @adiati98 and @BekahHW, we've come to the realization that giving contributors the option to either use the CLI tool or doing it manual is causing this confusion.  \r\n\r\nWe also noticed that people are not contributing to the pizza-verse repo in spite of our promotion efforts, making it difficult for us to achieve OpenSauced's goal to create a contribution pathway for people to grow in their open source journey. \r\n\r\n### Suggested solution\r\nFor the first part of the issue, we having the following solution:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Go the [\"Manual Selection\" section in step 5](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md).\r\n- [ ] Delete the directions:\r\n\r\n https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/4577a767191b640d3092b61a2c687c864fe96356/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md?plain=1#L162-L211\r\n\r\n- [ ] Go to step 6:\r\nhttps://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/4577a767191b640d3092b61a2c687c864fe96356/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md?plain=1#L147\r\n- [ ] Replace it with the following statement: \r\n`6. Add yourself to the guestbook with the CLI tool`\r\n\r\n- [ ] Go to the next paragraph and delete it: \r\nhttps://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/4577a767191b640d3092b61a2c687c864fe96356/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md?plain=1#L149-L156\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the second half of the issue, do the following to add a section about our [pizza-verse repo](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/README.md) in the [Let's Practical Section](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md):\r\n- [ ]  Go this line: https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/4577a767191b640d3092b61a2c687c864fe96356/05-how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md?plain=1#L245\r\n- [ ] Add the following statement next to it:\r\n`If you're ready for your next contribution, head on over to the [pizza-verse repo](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse) and follow the contribution guidelines for your next contribution. Once you're done, head on over to chapter 6 in this course.`\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Contributing Docs\r\n\r\n- [ ] I agree to follow this project's Contribution Docs",

This page aims to provide valuable resources and guidance for individuals looking to get started with open source or enhance their contributions to existing projects. The content will cover various aspects, from finding your first open-source project to effectively communicating with project maintainers.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nOpen source is a crucial aspect of the tech community, fostering collaboration and skill development. By creating a dedicated \"Open Source\" page, we aim to centralize resources and insights to make it easier for individuals, especially those new to open source, to navigate and contribute effectively. \r\n\r\nThe page will empower users with actionable items and guide them through the process of becoming active contributors.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this page represents an **opportunity for our community members to showcase their expertise and insights**. We encourage community members to contribute tech content they created, such as blog posts, videos, and other valuable resources, which will be featured in the respective sections of the \"Open Source\" page. This not only enhances the richness of the page but also provides a platform for community members to share their experiences and knowledge with a broader audience.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe \"Open Source\" page will consist of different sections, each focusing on specific intents, goals, and actionable items for readers. In addition, each section will incorporate links to related articles, videos, and tech content created by SheSharp's community, offering a rich and diverse set of resources. \r\n\r\nThis could be a section:\r\n\r\n###  Find An Open-Source Project\r\n\r\nThis section can feature:\r\n- Tips on choosing a project aligned with personal interests and skill level\r\n- Curated list of beginner-friendly projects across different technologies\r\n- Links to related articles and videos by SheSharp's community members sharing their tips\r\n\r\nThese are just examples to give an idea.\r\n\r\nFeel free to provide feedback and additional suggestions for sections and content.\r\n",

We're all working together to hit 50,000 words. ._\r\n\r\n## Keep track of our group progress here:\r\n\r\nhttps://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/nov-2021/\r\n\r\n## To add your latest November post:\r\n\r\n- Follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to create a fork of this repository and clone it to your local machine.\r\n- Create a branch called something like `monthlychallenge/add-new-post`\r\n- Open `src/monthlychallenges/nov-2021/nov-2021.json`\r\n- If you already have posts listed, find your name and add your newest post to the end of your list of `posts`\r\n- If this is your first post for the challenge, add your name and details to the end of the list. It should look like this:\r\n```\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"name\": \"Ayu\",\r\n\t\t\"blogLink\": \"https://adiatiayu.hashnode.dev\",\r\n\t\t\"posts\": [\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n \t\t\t\"title\": \"CSS Units\",\r\n\t\t\t\"url\": \"https://adiatiayu.hashnode.dev/css-units\",\r\n\t\t\t\"count\": 466\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n- Commit the update \r\n- At this point, you can preview the site locally, but it's not required. You will also be able to preview the changes after the PR is created.\r\n  - To test locally, follow the [Local Development steps listed in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/README.md#local-development)\r\n- Push your branch up\r\n- Create a Pull Request and be sure to [include a link to this issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests)\r\n- After the Pull Request is created, Netlify will automatically build a deploy preview and link to it in the Pull Request.\r\n\r\nAnd you're done!\r\n\r\nOur [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) has a lot of information about getting started with GitHub and Pull Requests, so you might want to take a look at that as well if you are new to this process.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to add any questions here in the comments!",

      "description": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Issue Context\n\nThere are a couple issues to fix with the newsletter subscribe form, found on https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/ (and individual newsletter issues).\r\n\r\nThe code that generates this form can be found here: https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk\r\n\r\nRunning a WAVE test will show three issues:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/138116508-0166ac5d-3a0f-45df-99b6-cf313ddadd0e.png)\r\n\r\n- Missing form label\r\n- Broken ARIA reference\r\n- Fieldset missing legend\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n### Form label:\r\n\r\nThe form includes a [honey pot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) field, but this field isn't labelled. The idea is that the field should be empty, but spam bots will be tricked into filling it out. We should add a label that is visually hidden, but has the text \"please leave this field empty\" or something like that.\r\n\r\n### Broken ARIA reference:\r\n\r\nThis is simply a typo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/8fc7a906be9a23898d2f98fb8883d78c06d148de/src/_includes/macros/newslettersub.njk#L13-L21\r\n\r\n`aria-describedby` is set to `emailHelp`, but the id of the help content is `nameHelp`. They should match.\r\n\r\n### Fieldset missing legend:\r\n\r\nFrom the WAVE tool:\r\n\r\n> If a higher level description is necessary for the user to understand the function or purpose of the controls within the fieldset, provide this description within the <legend>. If this description or grouping is not necessary, the fieldset should probably be removed. \r\n\r\nIn this case, we don't need a `fieldset`, and it can be safely removed.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add label to honeypot field\r\n- [ ] Fix `aria-describedby` value\r\n- [ ] Remove `fieldset`\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I've read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community",

      "description": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### What happened?\n\nThe logo sponsors section on the home page has some accessibility issues:\r\n\r\n![Image 2021-10-13 at 2 28 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360261/137191853-e14fb96e-9c8c-48d1-af68-ea39b0f685dc.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Adjacent links to the same location\r\n- Out of order headings (the title is an `h4` while the \"Our Supporters\" section is an `h2`\r\n\r\nHere's the code that produces that section:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/a77a14b94201467fada05dd3008be922d3459b6c/src/index.njk#L156-L219\r\n\r\nI think a neat way to fix this would be to wrap the entire contents of the `li` in the link (instead of two separate links). Then the whole block would become clickable. The next step would be to hide the image from screen readers via `alt=\"\"`, and style the contents so the whole section isn't pink. I'm open for other ideas, but I would like the image and the title to be clickable links to the url.\r\n\r\n### To fix:\r\n\r\nFor both the hard-coded Decentology section and the templated section below, \r\n\r\n- [ ] Wrap the contents in one `<a>` element\r\n- [ ] Update styles/class names as needed to keep the layout consistent\r\n- [ ] Hide the img from screen readers via `alt=\"\"`\r\n- [ ] Change `h4` to `h3` and style accordingly\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRun the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) on https://virtualcoffee.io\r\n\r\n\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n### Why redundant links matter:\r\n\r\n> When adjacent links go to the same location (such as a linked product image and an adjacent linked product name that go to the same product page) this results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen reader users.\r\n\r\n### Why skipped heading levels matter:\r\n\r\n> Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I've read the Code of Conduct and understand my responsibilities as a member of the Virtual Coffee community",

At build time, we'll pull down their GitHub profile and display their info on a page located at /members.\r\n\r\nThis is the first iteration of this feature, so we'll add features to it as we go.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note - only PRs from existing Virtual Coffee members will be accepted\r\n\r\nAttending one of our Virtual Coffee events is the best way to learn how to become a member.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Adding yourself to the members page:\r\n\r\n## GitHub Profile Information\r\n\r\nMembers can edit their GitHub profile at https://github.com/settings/profile\r\n\r\nvirtualcoffee.io will only ever have access to the public profile information, never anything private.\r\n\r\nInfo we'll use to build the members page:\r\n- Name\r\n- Profile Picture\r\n- URL\r\n- Bio\r\n- Twitter Username\r\n\r\nBefore you submit a PR, take a moment and check out this information to make sure it's accurate and you feel comfortable displaying it on our site!\r\n\r\n## How to add or update your profile:\r\n\r\nThe steps below involve your GitHub username. For each of the steps below, replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username (mine is `danieltott` for example).\r\n\r\n- Follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to create a fork of this repository and clone it to your local machine.\r\n- Create a branch called `members/yourusername`\r\n- **If you're adding your profile for the first time:**\r\n  - Create a copy of [`src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts`](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts) and name it `yourusername.ts`\r\n  - **NOTE:** for the _file name and export name_, please remove any dashes in your username. You can replace them with underscores or just remove them entirely. For example, if my username was `virtual-coffee`, we'd want to change that to `virtualcoffee.ts` for the file name, and for the export name in the next step.\r\n  - Replace `_EXAMPLE` on line 4 with your github username\r\n    ```diff\r\n    - export const _EXAMPLE: MemberObject = {\r\n    + export const yourusername: MemberObject = {\r\n    ```\r\n  - Update the `github` value to your username, and follow the comments in the file to customize any additional parts of your VC profile\r\n  - **Note** - if you already have the local version running, you'll need to stop the server and restart it to see the new file.\r\n  - Commit the new file\r\n- **If you're already on the page but would like to update your profile:**\r\n  - Find `src/content/members/members/_EXAMPLE.ts`\r\n  - Inside you will find the file all set up, follow the comments in the file to update any data you'd like\r\n  - Commit the modified file\r\n- Push your branch up to your fork\r\n- Create a Pull Request and link to this issue\r\n\r\nAt this point, the pull request will create a Deploy Preview that you can use to preview your changes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to try updating the data on your own, here are the steps you can follow, but _it's not required_.\r\n\r\n- To test locally, follow the [Local Development steps listed in our README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/README.md#local-development)\r\n- After the site is installed, you'll need to follow [these directions to create a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).\r\n  - The token only needs permission for the user => read:user scope to function for this task:\r\n    <img width=\"528\" alt=\"Screen shot of scopes form\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131928/113331986-9c795080-92ee-11eb-9e31-67d99eed5ded.png\">\r\n- Once you have your token, create a new file called `.env` and copy the contents from `.env.example`. Then, uncomment the `GITHUB_TOKEN` line, and replace `yourtoken` with your token created in the previous step.\r\n- Then run `yarn start` to preview your changes!\r\n- Again, these steps are not required for the PR to be accepted\r\n\r\nAnd you're done!\r\n\r\nOur [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) has a lot of information about getting started with GitHub and Pull Requests, so you might want to take a look at that as well if you are new to this process.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to add any questions here in the comments!",
